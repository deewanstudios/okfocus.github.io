I don’t know how this lie started but I’m so tired of people believing it. Every family has their problems. It doesn’t mean we never get along. Anyone can agree on something today and change their mind tomorrow.</p><p>A BIRD OF THE AIR, ACTRESS, CELEBRITY, CELEBRITY INTERVIEW, CRIMINAL MINDS, G.I. JOE, HAIR, I ALEX CROSS, INTERVIEW, J.J. ABRAMS, JACKSON HURST, MARGARET WHITTON, MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY, OPRAH WINFREY, RACHEL NICHOLS, STAR TREK, TYLER PERRY</p><p>ShockYa: The character of Fiona is something quite different for you, and I’m struck by another parallel since you mentioned “Alex Cross,”Â and Tyler Perry’s castingÂ in that seems to be something very different. What’s sort of been your insight or take on how he’s tackling a role already made famous by Morgan Freeman?</p><p>She recalls what happened the day she got the news that something had happened to Michael. ‘I got a call to come to the hospital. We rushed down there and when we got  there, we said: “Where is he?” and they took me to another room. They wanted to sit down and talk to me and that’s when I was told.</p><p>They have the same air of a person who has endured much, yet has a sense of naivety. More than anything else there is a feeling that she is not quite of this world.</p><p>Katherine’s favourite Michael Jackson song is Man In The Mirror and she is looking forward to it being performed at the concert which she is attending even though she doesn’t like flying.</p><p>Written by: Brent Simon</p><p>ShockYa: Well of course not.</p><p>That was before they were signed to any record companies. They were just in talent shows. And we were all there sitting around the table eating and talking and having fun.</p><p>Rachel Nichols is an actress, a former model, a sports fan, a foodie, a frequent traveler and an avid Twitterer. She is not, however, a reporter for ESPN given to undue amounts of hand gesticulations while talking. Well… that’s Rachel Nichols, too, actually. But a different one. The real Rachel Nichols — genuinely easygoing, and possessing of a developed personality of someone much uglier — is more apt to have names for her hands.</p><p>‘I used to cook soul food. In the wintertime we would buy a big piece of beef and put it in the freezer and I would freeze peaches so we would have steaks and gravy and rice and peach cobbler. We would always have a dessert. Maybe fried apple turnovers. Those were my happy days. But they will come again.</p><p>‘She took a pillow and one of his jackets, and said: “I don’t want a jacket that’s been cleaned. I want something with his scent on it.” She put the jacket over the pillow and she breathes it. It’s still there.  </p><p>

</p><p>God bless you Katherine. I would love to hug her at that time. Love.</p><p>Not really. I want to say to her, not many women would. But, instead, I ask does she get on with him? ‘Oh yes.’</p><p>RN: Yeah, I had never dyed my hair ever in myÂ life until “Star Trek,” when J.J. Abrams asked if I would. And for J.J. Abrams you kind of agree to do anything that he wants. If he’d asked if I would shave my head I probably would have said yes. So I dyed my hair for that and while I was shooting it I booked “G.I. Joe,” which was great because they wanted me to have red hair but just a slightly different (color of) red, which was fine. Then I went back to blonde, and that’s a long process to get the red color out of the hair. And then I was blonde for less than a year before I went back dark, which I really liked. I was going to keep that, but I was going on “Criminal Minds” and they wanted me to be blonde, so I had… well, I call it “the re-blonding experience,” because we had to re-blonde me quicker than we would have liked. So then it got a little bit damaged, and I was actually happy to go back to brown with “Alex Cross.” I’ll probably stay brown for a while and give my hair a chance to heal. But wearing a wig is also not super-fun either.</p><p>ShockYa: A sort of two-part question that you can fold into one answer — is auditioning something you feel comfortable with, or maybe finally arrived at a place of comfort with? And because this was so different a character was it perhaps any more nerve-racking than a typical audition?</p><img src='http://www.soundoffcolumn.com/images/beyonce_oprah.JPG' /><p>ShockYa: A sort of two-part question that you can fold into one answer — is auditioning something you feel comfortable with, or maybe finally arrived at a place of comfort with?

He was and always will be a man of integrity. The best person who has HAD here.
Understand that. Respect him
</p><p>Jermaine in his graphic book, You Are Not Alone: Michael Through A Brother’s Eyes, reveals that Michael’s chimp wore clothes and Poison perfume by Christian Dior. The book paints him in all his weirdness, but it exonerates him of any crime.</p><p>‘They’re doing OK,’ she says. ‘I’m doing OK. It’s hard being a mother and losing your child. It shouldn’t be that way round. There’s not a day goes by that I don’t...’ </p><p>Does that make her naive or strong? ‘I don’t have Michael’s pictures out all the time, but I have got some of his things. I’m never going to forget him. Every time I see something of his it just makes me feel bad.’ She shakes her head as if she both cherishes and is tortured by the memories.</p><p>Does she think that she can feel him around her and communicate with him and his spirit? She shakes her head. ‘Michael’s sleeping now and I know he’s not conscious of anything.’ She says this as a measure of ultimate sadness and relief. The profits from the concert will go to his favourite charities. </p><p>It sounds like he was in a panic. I don’t want to say it sounds like he was paranoid in front of her in case I make her cry again. ‘No,’ she says, very resolute, ‘I don’t think he was panicking. He would say it just like that if he were here with us today. He felt something was going to happen.’</p><p>ShockYa: Nice! I’ve had some other interviews recently where I’ve talked with actors and actresses about how they tend to accumulate wardrobe from all the movies that they do. And Fiona has some, well, rather unique fashion sensibilities. So –</p><p>It’s hard to grasp how this empathic, intelligent matriarch stood by as her husband Joe regularly beat his children if they didn’t get their songs right. It was also rumoured that he cheated on her. Does she still love him? ‘Well yes, I do. That’s a strange question.’ </p><p>Report abuse</p><p>We are no longer accepting comments on this article.</p><p>Report abuse</p><p>Brotherly love: Jermaine Jackson is opposed to the Michael Forever Tribute Concert to be held in the star's memory in Cardiff next month</p><p>Here I see parallels with Michael, to want to believe the good in people, that the world can be beautiful when it most definitely isn’t. </p><p>‘During the funeral when the children were given the crown to put on top of the casket, he put his hand on my shoulder and started to cry. He wanted to be strong because he was around all his cousins. From the moment they came from the hospital [after Michael died], they were all bawling their eyes out.’ She composes herself slightly. ‘He was a very good son. People tried to poison the world against him. All this molestation stuff was just a lie. </p><p>Her latest project is the independent-minded “A Bird of the Air,” in which she plays a free-spirited librarian, Fiona, who upends the life of a solitary loner, Lyman (Jackson Hurst), when she takes it upon herself to help him track down the past owners of a parrot that randomly flies into his trailer. Recently, ShockYa had the chance to speak to Nichols one-on-one, about the movie, the work Nichols put in to get her role, changing hair colors, and exactly why she calls her car Darth. The conversation is excerpted below:</p><p>ShockYa: You’ve mentioned Fiona being very different from characters you’ve played before, but in the movie Fiona has a name for her car, Sacagawea. And as you’ve discussed on “The Kevin and Bean Show” on KROQ, you have a name for your car, too.</p><img src='http://www.soundoffcolumn.com/images/beyonce_oprah.JPG' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='hair-commercial.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='bald-cap.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
