While they try to dissociate themselves from the established party system, there are still the steel girders (or perhaps infiltration) of neocon militarism and big business absolutism.</p><p>Say, how'd the Pats-Dolphins game turn out?</p><p>Our website:  "Chuck on the Right Side"</p><p>Thanks for printing Bill O'Reilly's reminder to the Obama bashers that taking a break, or a get-away vacation, is a healthy and doctor-recommended method for reducing mental and physical stress, thus reinvigorating our minds and bodies. The last thing we need right now is a president suffering from combat fatigue.</p><p>Chuck Lehmann</p><p>That was the pitch, at least. The result--featuring handmade signs, pre-programmed insults and shameless pandering to an esoteric audience--was less World Wrestling and more Battle Bots.</p><p>If the genres and execution sound confused, blame the venue and sponsor.</p><p>What does nuclear power do? It boils water. It is a complicated, expensive and dangerous method of boiling water. In the event of a nuclear meltdown, who pays for it? We do. The U.S. government insures each nuclear power plant. If each nuclear power plant had to purchase insurance on the private market, it could not function. The nuclear industry promised us more than a half-century ago that it would find a way to safely dispose of radioactive nuclear waste. It has not. All waste is still stored on-site. It is like building a house and using the john without connecting the john to a sewer. The house would smell, but it would not be as poisonous as radioactive waste. The radioactive waste remains poisonous for 240,000 years.</p><p>I agree with the Outlook cover article by Jerry Paul that we should stick to the facts about nuclear energy. He says that we could not maintain our quality of life if nuclear power were eliminated, since we get 20 percent of our power from nuclear. Our antiquated electrical grid loses more than two-thirds of the electricity generated. By comparison, Japan and Germany lose 20 percent in transmission. By upgrading our grid to the same efficiency as Japan or Germany, we would save more electricity than all of the nuclear power plants now generate.</p><img src='http://images.huffingtonpost.com/gen/74963/original.jpg' /><p>I agree with the Outlook cover article by Jerry Paul that we should stick to the facts about nuclear energy.

She got rudely kicked off the Tea Party tiger once Perry stepped in and she badly needed a strong showing.</p><p>Home ownership smart only when situation is right</p><p>For a time, eight GOP candidates with straightened hair, spray-on tans and varying levels of physical fitness (Hermain Cain and Newt Gingrich squatting on the slothful end, though Rick Santorum looks like he could muster a mean 5K) were counter-programming to Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.</p><p>This is the reason that, polling be damned, no one candidate can truly claim the Tea Party as their own, and also why sports competitions are best left to the professionals.</p><p>VIDEO: Idina Menzel reprises her role as Shelby Corcoran on "Glee,"stirring up old drama. </p><p>Rick Perry is running from his "Ponzi scheme" statements like Ned Beatty from banjo music.</p><p>Reach Tom Dotan here</p><p>Then there's the still-unachieved equilibrium between policy ideals and dinner table compassion. When Blitzer asked Paul whether he thought a hospital patient who doesn't have medical care should just be allowed to die, some members in the audience screamed out "yeah!" CNN producers began lowering themselves into industrial vats of sanitizer.</p><p>Also, there are many online communities for you to find support and dating! I recommend you to read the STD inspirational stories on the largest STD support and dating site STDslove. com. Hope that you find the stories helpful and informative. </p><img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3418/3850216294_f676666bb8.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='zentai-in-fur.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='power-dykes.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
