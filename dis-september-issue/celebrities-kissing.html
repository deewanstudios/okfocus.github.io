Charlie Sheen has amicably settled his $100 million lawsuit against 
Two and a Half Men creator 
Chuck Lorre and Warner Bros. Television. Sheen, fired from the CBS comedy this
year, brought the massive suit against his former employer in March in an attempt to receive
compensation for the eight canceled episodes from the eighth season of the sitcom, which went on
hiatus shortly after his dismissal. Although terms of the settlement haven’t been disclosed,
TMZ.com reported that the actor, 46, would get an immediate payout of $25 million — to spiral to
$100 million in syndication profits during the next decade.</p><p>Read Entire Blog</p><p>Former 
L Word star 
Leisha Hailey complained in a stream of Twitter messages on Monday that she and a
girlfriend were kicked off a Southwest Airlines flight in a dispute over kissing on a plane.
Hailey, 40, tweeted that a flight attendant had told her that Southwest “was a family airline and
kissing was not OK,” and that she and her companion were then “escorted off the plane for getting
upset about the issue.” The airline issued a statement saying, “We received several passenger
complaints characterizing the behavior as excessive.” It also said the decision was “based solely
on behavior and not gender.”</p><p>Francois Durand/Getty Images</p><p>BROWSE BY CATEGORY</p><p>More Life & Entertainment Blogs</p><img src='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NdjizHAuf6Q/SwVu7puIKCI/AAAAAAAADc4/3uRfYF3yL6o/s1600/Tom+Cruise+kissing+Katie+Holmes.jpg' /><p>More Life & Entertainment Blogs</p><p>Several of his comedies had military settings, including It Ain’t Half Hot Mum — set in wartime India and Burma — and Dad’s Army, about a hapless Home Guard unit.</p><p>Top Story RSS Feed</p><p>Purchase prints from our newspaper page gallery or request a recent or historic page by date.</p><p>Subscribe to home delivery of The Columbus Dispatch, The Dispatch E-Edition, The Dispatch for e-readers or a combination of all three.</p><p>Wed Sep 28 03:38:00 EDT 2011</p><p>Mail (will not be published) (required)</p><p>Tue Sep 27 09:12:00 EDT 2011</p><p>NOW!’s 17th annual Halloween writing contest kicks off today with a mysterious beginning to a

Rihanna permission to use his grain field to film a music video shut down the
production on Monday and chastised the pop singer for her “inappropriate” wardrobe. Rihanna, 23,
was dancing in a red handkerchief bikini when 
Alan Graham, 61, noticed her and drove over in his tractor to put a stop to
things. “I have an ethos, and I felt it was inappropriate,” Graham told the BBC. Some reports said
the singer had gone topless. “I requested them to stop, and they did.” Graham granted permission
for Rihanna and her film crew to use his field, he said, even though he wasn’t familiar with the
often scantily clad Grammy winner, whose hits include 
S&M and 
Disturbia. The shoot, for the new single 
We Found Love, has resumed in a different location, according to reports. The farmer and
the singer, according to Graham, parted on good terms, shaking hands as he went on his way. “I wish
no ill will against Rihanna and her friends,” he said later. “Perhaps they could acquaint
themselves with a greater God.”</p><p>Post your free ad</p><p>The racing game takes players "on a heart-pounding cross-country race from San Francisco to New York."
