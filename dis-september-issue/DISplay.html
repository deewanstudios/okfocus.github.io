							</p><p>Italy, Spain extend short-selling ban  </p><p>The one possible weakness of this tablet? Its price. Toshiba hasn't finalized pricing, but the numbers the company has tossed out as possibilities appear to be a bit steep. According to Toshiba, the tablet will “probably cost” $379 to $399 for the 16GB version, and $429 to $449 for the 32GB model. Such costs seem high for a 7-inch tablet, though it's worth noting that the inexpensive Lenovo A1 is $200 only because it skimps on internal memory, providing just 2GB.</p><p>A surprising feature to note is that the cable on the system is actually a standard Thunderbolt cable that is connected to an internal Thunderbolt port, instead of being soldered to the system's controller board. This means the system could technically be given a longer cord at some point (though major disassembly would be required to do this), if needed. Additionally, the system's speakers are larger than previous ones and should offer richer sound as a result.</p><p>

When I tried a preproduction unit in advance of Toshiba's announcement, the 7-inch Thrive had the sharpest, cleanest text I've seen yet on an Android tablet. The text rendering--something I've frequently cited as a weakness of Android 3.x Honeycomb tablets--appeared smooth. Google's operating system may play some part in what I perceive as poor text rendering in other Android tablets, or maybe earlier tablet displays simply weren't of a sufficiently high pixel depth to achieve the smooth text I crave. (Yes, the iPhone 4's crisp Retina display has spoiled me when it comes to anything that shows dots.) Like the 10.1-inch Thrive before it, the 7-inch model uses Toshiba's Adaptive Display and Resolution+ technology, which is supposed to help boost image quality, as well.</p><p>Even though the Fire only has a screen resolution of 1024 x 600 the text looks crisp, and vivid and will be easy on the eyes. Some may opt for the e-ink but this will ultimately come down to user need, and preference. Feel free to look over the rest of the images in the gallery provided, then let us know what you think in the comments below.

You won't find full-size ports here, though (as you do on its larger Thrive sibling). Under a single, neat flap are Micro-USB and Micro HDMI ports, and a MicroSD card slot.</p><p>Connect with MacFixIt</p><p>Ultra-fast, high capacity storage and backup.

			Password</p><p>U.S. stocks fall after extended rise</p><p>Shown in the photo above, we have the Kindle Touch on the left (top) with the new Kindle Fire and its IPS display on the bottom. One thing I do want to note first is Amazon has always touted their e-ink and awesome Kindle displays for working great in any light condition, especially outside. It will be interesting to see how the Kindle Fire and the IPS panel handle the direct sunlight, but for now all we have is some video comparing text on the two so give it a look and let us know what you think.
