"The boy-cut can create a bulge, falling in the middle of the tummy line," she says, which can create the notorious muffin top. Hailstone recommends going for high-waist cuts that elongate the leg, maximizing a sleek fit. </p><p>September 14, 2011 | 11:24 p.m.</p><p>Professional surfing is dominated now by the sleek shortboarders, but the longboarders aren't going away.</p><p>"Longboarding is still alive out there," Calkins said. "It doesn't have the financial backing, but it's still exciting. In the '80s, we had the 'rebirth of cool.' Longboarding came back and Dale starting running contests. There was some money involved, but it kind of fell apart.</p><p>Board of Education of the Tri-Valley Central School District is ac... more »</p><p>But for those who prefer going old school to the shredders on short boards, there is an alternative.</p><p>At Mme. Pirie's, Belleville carries 30AA to 56JJ. "The first thing we do is measure your size, and then we try on different bras," she says. "Every woman is different. It can be a real process. Sometimes the smaller busts are harder to fit than the larger ones."</p><p>Wednesday, September 28, 2011</p><p>Saturday's contest isn't only about the longboarders, as Calkins said he expects four of the top six tandem surf teams in the world to compete. And the stand-up paddleboarders provide a twist to surfing style as well.</p><p>Fitting Your Bra For You</p><img src='http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/6190/legmagictw5.jpg' /><p>Fitting Your Bra For You</p><p>As for those bothersome bouncing straps, Belleville suggests a smaller band size. Strap size has to do with how narrow your shoulders are, she says, not the fit of the bra itself. Similar rules apply to sports bras and strapless bras, our experts agree.</p><p>"A lot of women are concerned about panty lines, especially with form-fitting dresses," or even work pants, says Rosa Belleville, owner of Mme. Pirie's Famise Corset & Lingerie Shop in Albany. "Seamless panty line underwear is the answer." Top lines, including Jockey, Hanes, Calvin Klein, La Perla, Bali and Olga, all carry boy-cut, bikini and thong options in smooth microfibers that will make you look and feel your best.</p><p>
