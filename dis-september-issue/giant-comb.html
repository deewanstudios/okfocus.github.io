    </p><p>Why the fuss? The snails – from Africa – can grow up to 10 inches long and are known for their rabid breeding rate. They also eat more than 500 species of plants and even carry a form on non-fatal meningitis that can be passed onto humans. They’re considered so destructive that it is illegal it bring them into the U.S. A current investigation by federal officials is seeking to determine if a Florida resident smuggled them in (the man practices an African religion in which the snails’ juices are considered a sacrament). The Miami Herald reported that the man, Charles Stewart, may have been aided in the smuggling by an “African priestess” who smuggled the snails onto a Miami-bound flight by hiding them under her dress.</p><p>Functionally, how are they working out? Can less than 1.3
gallons per flush do the job?</p><p>I’ve wanted low-flows for years. Our toilets — downstairs and up
— empty giant cisterns with each flush. How much goes down the
drain? Five gallons? Seven gallons? A Roman aqueduct’s worth?</p><p>Aerial photos show flooding in the Adirondacks in Duck Hole after recent rain from Tropical Storm Irene. Officials have reopened many closed Adirondack trails.

congratulatory.</p><p>Without conferring with Cheryl, I visited the plumbing showroom
to make sure the free model wasn’t an aesthetic disaster. It
wasn’t. It was your basic white porcelain fixture. No fancy
features, but that was OK by me. We’re talking toilets, not
lifestyle.</p><p>The toilets flush beautifully.</p><img src='http://www.odditycentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/giant-haircut-550x366.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='anna-wintour-naked.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='minaj-nip-slip-.gif.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
