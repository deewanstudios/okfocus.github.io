TORONTO, Sept. 27, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --
In the upcoming movie, "What's Your Number?" Ally, played by Anna Faris, is told by a group of girlfriends that women who have had more than 20 sexual partners will not find a husband. The movie begs the question, "What is an acceptable number of partners?" or in this case "How many men is too many?"

Still worried that you will be judged by the double standard?  Women: don't answer until you hear his response, then divide by 2 and subtract 4. Men: worried that your number isn't high enough to impress her (if so, you are being foolish, women like men who are selective) then add 7. Not yet in the double digits? Add a zero.

"It is interesting how both men and women feel the gender bias does exist, yet they are not intimidated when it comes to dating someone with more sexual experience," notes Kim Hughes, Singles and Dating Expert for Lavalife.com.  "The number itself doesn't matter; it's the way you feel about it, and what it means to you."

For daters - especially women who have entered into double, even triple digits - there is still the fear of the gender bias and answering the "number" question can be tricky.

"Although it is possible that a high number of sexual partners could be off-putting to a potential mate, the past does not need to dictate the future," continues Hughes. "Regardless of the number, there are ways to address your sexual past."
