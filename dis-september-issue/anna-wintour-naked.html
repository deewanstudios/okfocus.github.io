Wearing fur is nothing more than flaunting a status symbol. Like driving a Rolls Royce or flying on a private jet. There are cheaper and more practical alternatives, but they wouldn't be so showy, would they?</p><p>Find the latest jobs in your sector:</p><p>Stepping out for a Turkish Coffee over at the University, momentarily.</p><p>

By Jess Cartner-Morley</p><p>The OA label is clearly part of the reason designers have embraced fur, and it is equally popular with customers. London-based designer Todd Lynn's clothes are characterised by sharp tailoring and the use of skins and fur. "I'm an animal lover myself," he says, "so I don't do this without a heart. My mantra is 'If it's cheap, there's a problem'. I go to reputable tanneries, I'm pretty careful about that.

"Many are caught in steel-jaw traps in which they languish for days, starving and suffering excruciating pain. Fur farms are concentration camps for wild animals – many go insane in their cramped wire cages, unable to do anything that is natural to them. They are killed in crude ways, such as neck-breaking and painful electrocution." </p><p>

"We have a no-fur policy at Elle – we do not shoot it," explains Jenny Dickinson, the magazine's acting editor. "It can be harder when working on our bi-annual round-up, 'Elle Collections'. The magazine shows our reader the international collections in their entirety and that often involves so much fur that it's hard to cut it out altogether. But we try and keep appearances to a minimum."</p><p>

"When a fur garment or product carries the OA label," says the literature, "consumers know that the fur has come from a country where welfare regulations or standard governing fur production are in force." These countries include Scandinavia, Holland, Poland, North America and Canada – all of which, the industry is keen to point out, have made a living from fur since time immemorial and are home to rural communities which rely on the fur trade as a lifeline.</p><p>Pictures, info about recently sold single-family homes in Collier and Lee.</p><p>The way the climate is fucked up (thanx to your anglo polluters output, too) I suspect the Brits will soon get the climate of Nordic countries. There is some evidence for this; this summer was the coldest and rainiest for 30 years or so while here it was the warmest for the same period. When winters get as cold as they've traditionally been in here with plenty of snow and subzero, (say around minus 20 to minus 30) then we can see how much the Brits really like wearing those synthetic fibers, most of which cannot hold any warmth and just how many luv their pets so much as they say or how much they really fancy going naked... And remember wool comes from animals , too!</p><p>" Between fur coats and nudity, there is a middle ground."</p><p>

It was reminiscent of my favorite season-ender to “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” entitled “Best of Both Worlds.” That episode found Capt. Jean-Luc Picard assimilated by the Borg, and threatening the crew of the starship Enterprise with annihilation. Fade to black. Then four months of summer reruns while you ponder what you just watched.</p><p>21 September 2011 8:38PM</p><p>These were the days following the initial rush of Peta outrage, when fur became a dirty word in fashion and several magazines issued statements against the use of fur; The Independent still abides by a no-fur policy in its fashion pages. Designers shunned it as customers frowned and the industry looked to be, if not in terminal decline, then certainly in hot water.</p><p>Wearing fur in L.A. winter temperatures of 27C (or higher) went away with I Love Lucy.</p><p>It is ridiculous to want to stop cruelty to animals? Keep pouting Ms Freeman, you just failed the humanity test.</p><p>So Monday night I caught the premiere of “Hawaii Five-O” (CBS). For those of you who watch, you’ll recall that at the end of last season our leading man was in quite a quandary. Steve McGarrett (Alex O’Loughlin), head of Hawaii’s special Five-O task force, had been caught standing over the governor’s body holding a gun, after breaking into her “state”-ly mansion.</p><p>Eating. I don't mean just eating dead animals, or drinking milk out of an animal. Just eating is weird. Putting strange objects in our mouths, chewing and swallowing them. I mean. I've been thinking about it a lot lately and it's freaking me out a little. And I'd stop doing it, only I'd get hungry. </p><p>Become a fan of the Naples Daily News on Facebook.

Apart from Eskimos and Siberians?</p><p>21 September 2011 7:40PM</p><p>To the 'if you eat meat and wear leather and you're anti-fur you're a hypocrite' people:</p><p>And there are some places where it always has been. In countries like Russia and Canada, fur-wearing is a heritage, simply because there is no better insulator against the sub-zero temperatures; in Spain, too, fur is ubiquitous – Spanish high-street giant Zara recently added rabbit trim to some garments. But that's not to say learned behaviour shouldn't be undone.</p><p>He speaks from his office in the label's flagship store in Mayfair, a serene, uplit space in which feather-light furs trim silk, wool, even sequinned shift dresses. The garments are as far from the industry's bulky dowager stereotypes and murky past as, insists Zilberkweit, their methods of production.
