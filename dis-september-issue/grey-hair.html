If there are only a few, Summers suggests plucking them out, but if hair removal down there has you cringing, then there's always hair dye.</p><p>
        I have a couple which I actually just pull out!
        For those with a few more greys, I'd recommend Goldwell Colourance mousse in you hair colour!

Nancy Jarecki, an American businesswoman, saw a gap for the product when she observed women walking out of hair salons with little paper bags in hand. When she questioned the salon, they said it was small bottles of hair dye to make the hair down there match their colour on top.</p><p>Ahd Kristin McMenamy (sp?) who not only has grey hair, but waist-length grey hair. She's never out of Vogue Italia.</p><p>My hair is curly and mid-length, mostly silver now with a bit of the original dark underneath. No, it does not look like a scrub pad for washing up pots and pans; it looks very nice actually, and I get lots of compliments from men and women alike. I'm very annoyed by the current prejudice against curly hair. Like cataleptic, since my hair was very dark by the time it got to 50%+ greys I had to redye it constantly - it was hard on my hair, I was worried about health effects and I don't really think it was making me look younger. And I sure as hell wasn't about to become one of those middle-aged fake blondes, like Donatella Versace. </p><p>19 September 2011 4:41AM</p><p>Maybe it’s time to add another kid to the mix.</p><p>20 Jul 2011</p><p>20 September 2011 12:50PM</p><p>Turn autoplay on</p><p>I've always felt that style was more important than colour.  Having said that, as a former redhead I always avoided colouring.  If memory serves Anne Shirley's disaster, in Anne of Green Gables, resulting in green locks perhaps played a part in that.  More realistically i just couldn't be arsed to keep it up.</p><p>This article has reminded me, I need to dye my hair.... my only consideration is, home or hairdresser.....</p><p>My mum started going grey in her 30's, but it went grey in random patches rather than evenly. She dyed it until it started becoming vaguely even and presentable</p><p>I have grey hairs and I have stopped buying women’s magazines because I am too old for bull and covering my grey is a better investment if I want to keep my job.</p><p>This is the second fashion article I've commented on in 2 days, I need therapy, ah well, at least I'll be on trend.... yawn....</p><p>I’m with you ratgirlny.  I mean it’s great he had an aha moment and all of these was obviously an honest recount of the experience so it was interesting. But he did say he realized what it would take if he unexpectedly had to take care of business, and I think that revelation was worth the whole experiment, I guess.  I’m a single mom by choice and it’s NOT easy but believe me I handle it and have proudly raised an exceptional kindergartner. Wish I had some more “me” time but with aging parents I am not comfortable leaving him there for any extended periods (even just a weekend) anymore. My life is truly a juggle but I also truly love it.</p><p>

Its plain name is far more appealing than "What not to wear" and its ilk. </p><p>20 September 2011 3:01PM</p><p>18 September 2011 5:01AM</p><p>1) this is a multi-billion dollar industry</p><p>I found my first grey hair at the age of 24, by 27 I had to resort to dying it reguarly at home (my then boyfriend and now husband does an excellent job of it!). Now in my early 30's I worry about the chemical content of these hair dyes. I never use permanant, but even so, just the smell of the stuff and the care instructions makes you aware that there is nothing natural about applying hair colour. Yes, you can try henna - but do you really have 8 hrs to spare wandering around the house smelling vile - I don't! </p><p>Jarecki later asked a gynaecologist friend to estimate how many women had grey pubic hair and the result was that almost no women had the same colour hair on their head as they did in their pubic area. This sealed the deal for Jarecki who began to develop a product that would be effective in dying that rather sensitive area successfully.</p><p>

I’m sure he’s a great father and all, because there are far more important things in childrearing than the logistics of football practice and piano lessons.  However, this series really only focused on logistics, and, honestly, a responsible, high-school-aged babysitter could have driven the  kid around with similar effectiveness.  It’s not rocket science.</p><p>21 September 2011 6:03PM</p><p>More galleries</p><img src='http://media.nowpublic.net/images//34/3/343e4d32c0fa44573badfef223634eb5.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='spiky-brown.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='shaved-nape-haircut.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
