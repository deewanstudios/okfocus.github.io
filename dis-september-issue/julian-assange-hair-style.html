In this Gothic city - a noir city - I try to map the great uproar of ideas, commerce and affairs that unfold within them. "The grid is the city's legible framework," says Mike Scott, a town planner who in the mid-1980s was appointed the city council's first urban designer. "But it has another layer to it - a fine grain of paths and pedestrian movements, an unplanned rabbit warren to get lost and find yourself in."</p><p>For three days I am transfixed by all that's going on in this parallel world - by the pedestrian tides through Degraves Street, the bottleneck at Centre Place, the clip-clopping footfalls, by curious names (Pink Alley, Lush Lane, Equitable Place) and their visual poetry of old plumbing, brick bonds, rubbish skips and rivulets of greasy water.</p><p>

</p><p>In La Trobe Place I'm sidetracked by an installation of Hong Kong light boxes and neon banners that glow in the colours of persuasion. From The Causeway I'm stalled by the glimpsed shaft of the vertically finned facade of Myer's 1933 flagship emporium, a modernist vision that I think encapsulates all the style of Melbourne.</p><p>Select type of offense: </p><p>Troubled youth: Julian Assange spent a peripatetic childhood keeping away from his mother's violent sometime partner</p><p>

					The Ten Best Thrillers  
	                </p><p>Offensive: Sexually explicit or offensive language</p><p>Julian Assange, the controversial founder of WikiLeaks, speaks to Steve Kroft about the U.S. attempt to indict him on criminal charges and the torrent of criticism aimed at him for publishing classified documents.</p><p>It's a radical departure from the lifestyle that the peripatetic Internet muckraker is used to - bounding from city to city, country to country, and regularly changing his cell phones, hair styles and general appearance, he says, to elude surveillance and avoid being killed, kidnapped or arrested. </p><p>"There's a richness in the exploration," says Scott, who co-wrote the City of Melbourne's 1985 strategy plan, the blueprint for the renewal of these hitherto mostly neglected rights-of-way. "Visitors can spend a full day walking the laneways and come out feeling as though they've been in another city."</p><p>In 1959, the Hollywood femme fatale, Ava Gardner, was reported to have said: "On the Beach is a story about the end of the world and Melbourne sure is the right place to film it."</p><p>
My mother changed her name. We worked out that Leif must have had contacts 
  within the social security administration – that was how The Family is 
  thought to have worked – so it seemed best to change the names that would be 
  held inside the government computer system. But he was quite a gifted talker 
  and would get friends to supply him with information about our whereabouts 
  and he would always catch up. It was a private investigator who eventually 
  came and told us about his close relationship with the Anne Hamilton-Byrne 
  cult. We were living in Fern Tree Gully, and I was now 16 years old. We'd 
  come to the end of the road. Also, I was feeling almost a man myself and was 
  ready to front-up to him. Masculinity and its discontents could be addressed 
  here, but let's just say I knew I could waste him and he appeared to know 
  it, too. He was lurking round the bounds of the house and I walked over and 
  told him to fuck off. It was the first and the last time, and something in 
  the way I said it ensured that we would never see him again.
</p><p>"It's easy enough to walk around a Manhattan block but people here had to find shortcuts and other ways through the grid."</p><p>When Steve Kroft first interviewed Assange last January, he was already under investigation by the Justice Department for publishing classified material and possible violations of the Espionage Act. He was also under house arrest in Britain fighting extradition to Sweden in connection with two sexual assault cases, which he has called part of a smear campaign against him. </p><p>Italian Waiters Club</p><img src='http://melaniekillingervowell.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/assange-hair-winner.png?w=222&h=214' /><p>Italian Waiters Club</p><p>

I was granted bail on the 14th only to be told that the Swedish authorities 
  had appealed against the decision and that I would have to be sent back to 
  Wandsworth. It was hard to take, having to leave my friends and supporters 
  behind once again, having to leave the talking to my lawyers, having to sit 
  inside the prison van once more as it crawled through the media scrum. It 
  was hard to enter my cell once more and hear the door shut behind me. But as 
  I had told my mother before the hearing, my convictions were unfaltering and 
  my ideals were not shaken by my circumstances.
</p><p>
My mother was in love with Leif. And I was too young to understand what sexual 
  love was all about. I just knew that he wasn't my father and that he was a 
  sinister presence. He tried, again and again, to make the case that I should 
  not reject him and he had this thing with my mother and he was my brother's 
  father and everything. But a time came when I told him I no longer accepted 
  this deal. He had lied to us in a way that I hadn't known adults could lie. 
  I remember he once said all ugly people should be killed. He beat my mother 
  from time to time, and you felt he might be capable of just about anything. 
  I wanted him to leave, as he had promised me he would, but he denied that 
  the conversation had ever happened.
</p><p>In Bennetts Lane, named after a former Melbourne mayor and home to soup kitchens during the Great Depression, I take a table at its eponymous jazz club and wonder about a surprise gig by the artist formerly known as Prince. And in the Shanghai Dumpling Restaurant on Tattersalls Lane I'm happy to be persuaded by a waiter who suggests the vegetarian dumplings. "Everybody tries these, all the people," he says.</p><p>How else to explain my diversions? On Waratah Place I'm waylaid by a poster on the door of Wah Wah Lounge: "No rat tails. No Ed Hardy. No Elwood. No Pointy Toe Formal Shoes. No Suits. No Skate Wear."</p><p>

After years of being elsewhere I've returned to this city of hard edges - all bluestones and square street corners - intrigued by the story of a painted punk-rat in an alley long ago named after its dominant trade of stocking-making.</p><p>My own father was missing from my life, and only became part of it again when I was grown up. But it meant that Brett Assange was the male figure I related to, the good father. Brett was one of those cool 1970s people who were into guitars and everything that went with the music scene. I've got his name – Assange – an unusual one which comes from Mr Sang, or ah-sang in Cantonese: his great-great-great-grandfather was a Taiwanese pirate. Brett and my mother divorced when I was nine. He had been good to me, and was good in general, but not so good to himself, and the end of their relationship represents the end of a kind of innocence in my life.</p><p>I climb 20 wooden steps at 20 Meyers Place and open a door on the simple pleasures of the Italian Waiters Club, an eatery that since 1962 has been filled with metal-frame chairs, brown laminate tables, fluorescent light and diners enjoying hearty helpings of spaghetti marinara.</p><p>
My stepfather's place in our family was usurped by a man called Leif Meynell. 
  I remember he had shoulder-length blond hair and was quite good-looking; a 
  high forehead, and the characteristic dimpled white mark of a smallpox 
  injection on his arm. From the darkness at his roots, it was obvious he 
  bleached his hair. And one time I looked in his wallet and saw that all his 
  cards were in different names. He was some sort of musician and played the 
  guitar. But mainly he was a kind of ghost and a threatening mystery to us.

After two more nights in jail I was back in court, the High Court this time, 
  on 16 December. I have nothing profound to say about the judge, except to 
  suggest that he behaved throughout as if there was a correspondent from The 
  Times perched on his shoulder. It was hard otherwise to see why he reckoned 
  my bail should be so high and my tagging so severe. In his mind I was some 
  kind of shadowy, movie-style kingpin, likely to disappear at any minute in a 
  puff of smoke, a souped-up helicopter, or a hail of laserfire. In fact, my 
  circumstances were more ordinary than he could have known.
