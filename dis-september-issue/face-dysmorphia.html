I often see this dysmorphia with women's arms. They want their arms to be skin and bone and at the same time want muscle definition,” he explained. “It is usually focused on a certain area such as the breasts, face, or general thinness, and do I think there is an LA microculture that is somewhat out of synch with many other cities? I think the idea of what beauty is gets morphed in a city where most people are attractive.”</p><p>

    Sadly, this all changed when her husband, my new son-in-law, became ill with a terminal cancer. At her urgent request, I moved from my home on the West Coast to their home on the East Coast in order to help during his illness and subsequent passing.

    The other weekend I went on a trip with some friends to a town near where he lives, and I let him know we would be there. He came down and spent the day with us, and it was great. No discomfort, and afterward he didn't cut me off, though our contact is not as intense as it was before.

    I break down and cry at least twice a week and feel hopeless about my situation most of the time. I want to at least try and see if I can finish this. But I've started to fantasize about quitting. It would be a huge step backward. I'd have to start to think about "what I want to do" all over again. I mostly enjoy writing about arts and culture, and I still want to do that. But I question if this is the right path to that. Everything about this program feels unnatural. I dislike the hectic and fast-paced nature of it, which again makes me question being a journalist in the first place. It feels like they're trying to cram everything into such short amounts of time, so I don't have time to get a grip on what I'm trying to learn.

Why should they? Your good sense derives from the moralistic fiction that underlies our astounding hypocrisy about beauty and sex. Forget these abstract values you mention. Who are these people who seem to think that your efforts to make yourself beautiful and thus raise your value in our culture demean you? Who would not want the rewards of beauty? I see no reason to denigrate the work you have done to make yourself beautiful.</p><p>Image courtesy of Christopher Payne via NPR</p><p>
    Are these stupid ego boosts worth spending four hours of my life per day doing things I don't want to do? In truth I'm nerdy and introverted and prefer to read rather than go to the gym. But I want a boyfriend and that won't happen if I stay home and never make an effort with my appearance -- can you see the crazy thought cycle here? Worst of all is that now I judge men for having a gut or having bad teeth, and I am more attracted to conventionally good-looking guys, who before would never look twice at me. I feel like your readers are going to kill me for saying these things, but I feel like everyone thinks these things and doesn't say them.

    I am very much in love with this girl, and I want her in my life in a serious way. I know that she feels the same way. I truly don't believe that she would ever actively try to hurt me. But I have this horrible, nagging feeling that the first time we get in a big fight, or if our sex life stagnates, or whatever else causes people to wander, she'd start sneaking around. She gets seriously offended when I suggest this, but again, doesn't outright promise otherwise.

  </p><p>How much of that value is due to your beauty? Do you suppose that a contemptibly ugly person with your same skills would occupy your job? Of course not. The only question is, what percentage did your beauty contribute to your employment. That's not to denigrate your talents, but to simply make an observation. You have seen how things work from both sides. You know this to be true. You're doing the only rational thing: You're responding to the market.</p><p>They must grieve. Given the harsh and hurried way we live in America, and perhaps more so on the East Coast than the West, grief is often cut short, and we see the distortion this causes in many ways. If we do not grieve -- that is, if we do not actively and with some determination move through the experience of loss and allow the loss to take a roomy place within us -- then our loss will set about to destroy us. It will work to bring us to our knees until we acknowledge it and do what is necessary. Depression is one way this happens. Drug abuse and suicidal behavior are others. It is possible that your daughter is moving through a period of depression. We can't know, of course. But we can allow for the possibility.</p><p>Image courtesy of Christopher Payne via NPR</p><p>What? You want more advice?</p><p>That seems fair, doesn't it? Then you have some choices.

</p><p>I don't see why each generation shouldn't try to change the world. When I was 21, I thought we were going to change the world. We tried to fashion a new world of relationships that were more realistic and true to our spirits.</p><p>
    When that sad time came, I realized my daughter couldn't survive financially without my input, so I offered to stay with her until her daughter went into college (about five or six years) and she herself had been able to get a nursing degree. We share the expenses of the household and then spend our own money as we please. There hasn't been any controversy about any of this.
  </p><p>
    I'm one of those people who always hears, "I don't know why nobody's snapped you up yet!" Actually, several people have tried, but usually one of two things happens -- they are looking for sex only, or they want more but we just don't have enough things in common to have a good relationship. My last relationship was with a really decent, sweet guy; it was drama-free, and lasted a year; but it basically turned into a "weekend-in-bed" relationship with not much happening during the week.
  </p><p>
    I don't feel comfortable talking about this to my daughter, as I think I may become too emotional, and she doesn't like it when I do that. (That is what happened four years ago.) I don't want to find myself ostracized in what should be my own home, and shunned like some stranger, but this is rapidly what is happening.
  </p><p>Can you do that?</p><p>
    How can I make this work?
  </p><p>But then there are the people who fuck you over.</p><p>This will only be a start, of course. It is important to remember that your daughter and granddaughter are both reeling from this event. They have lost something big that they cannot replace. They are feeling things they cannot control or ignore. They need some convalescence. This is going to take a while. You've done a good thing by coming here. But they are wrapped up in their grief and fear and it is not going to be easy. They aren't going to snap out of this right away.</p><p>Would it be possible for you to arrange a little outing with your daughter and granddaughter, someplace quiet by the water, under some trees, where the three of you could relax and the granddaughter could play? If possible, make it a couple of days. Spend the night. Get lots of sleep. Don't do much. Rest.</p><p>
    Instead, I've fallen very quickly back into depression. My thoughts are consumed with him and I am once again flattened by the sadness. In a way I hadn't before, I miss him desperately. I wake up every morning wishing he was next to me. I've shut everybody out again, stopped looking for work, and spend most of my days sleeping, yet again. I'm lost and I don't know how to pull out of this again. Although I know with every fiber of my rational mind that I should not contact him and that no good can come of having him in my life, I am overwhelmed with these feelings that I can only explain away as female biology. My brain is trying to find ways to rationalize the following statement: "If he is no longer with her, it stands to reason that he should be with me again." I feel hurt that he hasn't tried to get back together with me and sad that he destroyed what we had to pursue something that turned out to be so fleeting. I want to shake him and ask him, "Was it worth it?" I want to remind him how wonderful we were together, before the hurt and the betrayal. But these are ridiculous thoughts that I have no intention of entertaining. Instead I lie in bed tortured, wondering how and when I can get my life back.

    I did add him, but not without trepidation. The fact is that I accepted a long time ago that he was "messy" when it came to relationships and his ability to participate in them, and even had a year-long relationship during his absence. But there was still a dormant seed of attachment to him in me, and when he reappeared last fall -- thankfully, after I'd ended the other relationship -- it didn't take much for it to take root and grow into hope against hope that maybe he was "ready" this time. He knows very well who I am, and broke off our friendship over it before, but still invited me to go stay with him in a remote cabin in the mountains with a single bed, and made it "clear" (if with no direct references to his own sexuality) that he had no problem with gayness. But the fact that he pulled away after planning his trip for so long, and then cut off contact after seeing me, convinces me that he still does have issues with it. And yet he also seems unable to stay away. This is what makes me doubt his psychologist's appraisal; it feels a lot more like someone who is simply gay and attached but unable to follow through, perhaps because he hasn't dealt with the trauma of his abuse.

    And then I received an email from my ex nonchalantly asking if we could be friends again. The grapevine quickly informed me that he and his new love had split. At first I felt palpable outrage -- how dare he contact me so casually. I felt like I was owed an apology, or at the very least an acknowledgment of how badly he'd behaved. I did not respond; instead, I blocked him from contacting me and searched my psyche for the schadenfreude that was sure to come.
  </p><p>If he doesn't want kids, he can refuse. But you deserve to know. Then you can make informed choices. He may complain that you are pressuring him but all you are really doing is taking action to ensure that the issue is clarified and resolved. And it is good for you to do this now. It is good to get the issue out in the open in a timely way.</p><p>Fed up with the rumors and mystery surrounding Michael’s life and death, Jackson decided to pen a heartfelt book, “You Are Not Alone, Michael: Through a Brother’s Eyes.” Partly a look at their family’s early years in Gary, Ind., and the phenomenal success of The Jackson 5, the memoir also delves into Michael’s final days and all the questions surrounding his death. </p><p>Image courtesy of Christopher Payne via NPR</p><p>Your dad has always been vilified, but you defend him in the book.</p><p>

  </p><p>If you can, then you will have improved your life. If you cannot do this, then I suggest you begin a course of psychotherapy in order to examine and ultimately change whatever it is that is driving you to remain in this man's orbit.</p><p>
    And then, suddenly, no contact. No answers to calls, messages, emails. This went on for three or four days, then I got an email telling me that he felt he wasn't gay, and felt like he'd been giving me the wrong impression. (Writing messages like "I want to give myself to you spiritually and physically," well yes, I'd say so.) He said what he was really after was love, and I'd given him that, but he could never, ever go into a gay relationship.
