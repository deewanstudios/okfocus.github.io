It's too expensive, and the best stuff is underfunded.  I see a lot of corny mass production; the exclusive next level pieces exist only in sample.  Fashion is wack right now for the most part. It's mad branding and no love!Related  • As Spring 2012 Shows Unfold, Music Heightens An Ordinary Mood  • Legendary British DJ Mary Anne Hobbs' Brave New Frontier: Primetime</p><p>Obsessing over an album's nomenclature is often a fruitless endeavour: these are names, lest we forget, often blindly pulled out of a popstar's arse and shouldn't be scrutinized for clues like ancient runes. Yet one would hope there's something meatier than mere Latin window-dressing behind the title of Zola Jesus's latest full-length. Nika Roza Danilova may have reluctantly made goth trendy once more with Stridilum II, buoyed by her prodigious set of pipes, but all that thunderous balladry became slightly… blustery, once the initial what-the-fuck factor faded away. Plumping for a name that's borrowed from the age-old philosophical concern with our compulsion for self-evolution, then, births the prospect of Danilova departing from the crescendo-laden formula of lore to embrace fresher climes.</p><p>End of sidebar.

I throw a party in New York called GHE20G0TH1K with my best friend $hayne and we also hold down his line Hood By Air.  </p><p>Visit Coppercon31 at    www.coppercon.org</p><p>On 'Vessel', her splintered and spectral vocal is processed through sheets of twisted metal until it emerges, refused, as if possessed by mechanical demons, while 'In Your Nature' is similarly cold and eerie, coated with a cyber-sheen that, despite the "burning light" imagery and hounds-from-hell drumming , is light-years away from the medieval vamp aesthetic that was routinely plundered on Stridulum…. 'Ixode' is a slow-burning death-disco stomp, while the eerie, woozy chanting of 'Seekir' turns into  blackened synthpop, blessed with a throbbing dancefloor pulse that transforms Danilova's vocal into something remarkably, and macabrely, diva-like.</p><p>

The nurse later discovered that a male radiographer at her workplace had stolen the identity of Jones, an American porn star.Jordan Henig later pleaded guilty to unlawful stalking and was fined $4000 by a Southport magistrate.Ms Fitzgerald was left betrayed, embarrassed and depressed and had to leave her job. But the 30-year-old is now trying to put the incident behind her by making a film that aims to warn others about the dangers of internet stalkers.</p><p>What is your Fashion Week involvement?This fashion week I worked with Gerlan Jeans; it was a crazy experience. I almost quit because I was so nervous! But it worked out really well. I found so many amazing new tracks: a lot of early 90's Memphis rap, really dark songs, and angsty Aggrotech.  I also did the music for the Hood By Air show alongside $hayne.  We freestyled using the CD-Js hot cues as a sampler.  Our set list included an early Nineties System of a Down acapella and a chopped and screwed Angolan kuduro trance.  </p><p>Back to top of page</p><p>Thanks for visiting.</p><p>

Well, I wanted baby blue and it was gonna be hard so I decided on green because it's just the one! It's the color of weed, money, the future, progress. It's just direct and it was the exact color of Gerlan's slime, which helps.  </p><img src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n7Vt1sT-3_4/S7ZQiWzaHXI/AAAAAAAAIio/kmfr8x0dows/s1600/The_Cyber_Goth_42.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='woman-goatee.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='balinese-fashion.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
