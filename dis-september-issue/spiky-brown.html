For the uninitiated, the manufacture of compost would seem no more involved than a simple tossing of “stuff” into a container and standing by for rot, but to La Mesa’s Charles Anacker, it’s an art.</p><p>

  </p><p>There’s a lot to learn after you’ve yanked the last stubborn plug of Bermuda grass. To that end, it’s imperative to educate yourself about sites and soils, micro-climates and drainage, the kinds of details that standard-issue, HOA-friendly lawns don’t bring into play. Among these factors, soil composition is deemed to be the most critical; the county’s predominant clay is reviled. Janet Lancaster declares, “We have the best growing conditions and the worst soil.”</p><p>

LSU AgCenter scientist Victoria Bayless identified ants collected at a home in Sulphur, La., as hairy crazy ants — the first on record in the state. She says she wasn’t surprised because entomologists for several years have expected the insects (also known as  Caribbean crazy ants and the Raspberry crazy ants) to reach Louisiana from southeastern Texas. Parts of Mississippi also report colonies.</p><p>Is the effort worth it? Even if one can harvest quantifiable (albeit modest) savings in the form of lower water bills, does it make economic sense to uproot a lawn and replace it with veggies? When I asked Greenamyer whether lawn conversions result in lower food costs for the home-grower, he was equivocal. “It depends on how you value your time.”</p><p>

      </p><p>Newsletters</p><p>Other home-food gardeners with whom I spoke claim that one needn’t spend exorbitant sums to save modest amounts. In the case of the Lancasters, total expenditures on behalf of a front-yard installation, including the complementary water-harvesting/recycling system, have amounted to around $2000. Accordingly, with water usage cut in half, they’re no more than a couple of years away from breaking even, not counting savings accrued by limiting store-bought produce. (For the record, Janet Lancaster admits to having paid landscapers around $8000 less than a decade ago to have Marathon fescue turf and a pop-up sprinkler system put in.)</p><p>Home | About Us | Contact Us | Site Map | Privacy Policy | Terms of Use | Advertise With Us | Geek Tools | National Advertising</p><p>"The summer is when you see most of your spiders," said Adam Jones, Vice President/Director of Quality Assurance.

Maybe it’s the narrow, winding Spring Valley streets, holdovers from faded ruritania. In front, there’s a small, intact lawn under the shade of gnarled pepper trees. The house itself feels reminiscent of something in Marin or Mendocino. What led them to remove their back lawn? Maveh explains, “After I took a class on xeriscape gardening, I became fascinated. I was never much of a lawn fan to begin with. It’s important to have a diversity of plants, especially native species, to avoid a monoculture. “</p><p>

Who doesn’t like fresh produce that you eat the moment it’s picked? There’s also satisfaction in knowing the history of your food.” Lions says it’s not mandatory to despise lawns. “They have a place. You can’t play baseball in a vegetable garden, for example. And a lawn is a nice place to play with your infant. But they shouldn’t be the dominant culture. The [lawn-to-food] movement isn’t so much a reaction against something as it is a proaction in favor of something else. Years ago, it was the norm to have a vegetable garden at home. We’re just going back to that.” He also touts the home-cultivation of edibles as a superior form of exercise. “Some people go to the gym and pay to use a treadmill. What do they get out of that? Nuthin’. But when you go out to your garden, you get fresh air, exercise, and a basket full of produce.”</p><img src='http://www.hempnecklacestore.com/6530-1232-large/spiked-brown-leather-bracelet.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='counterfeit-bags.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='grey-hair.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
