He's also among the 80-90 people arrested during Occupy Wall Street's march on Union Square this past Saturday. Ben gave us an account of his arrest for disorderly conduct and detainment that day that's the most detailed we've heard so far. He says that he "fell in love with the fact that [Occupy Wall Street] was a direct democratic process" and started going down to Zuccotti Park every day before the chaos of Saturday with some of his friends from school. (Keep in mind that this is the account of just one protester and doesn't necessarily speak to the experiences of others.) </p><p>spruce
I am totally shocked and dismayed at how most of the comments below are ready to condemn the RCMP when an investigation has not even been done yet.  Yes, there are questions and I am sure they will be answered but EVERYONE is innocent until proven guilty.  Enough about the police being below average intelligence - that is complete rot as they usually do catch the so called people that are "smarter".  I cannot believe some of you - if there weren't RCMP or police, where would this country be!!</p><p>I personally escaped the mayhem with about 50 other people. We walked down 12th Street to University Place, I think. At that point, there was police netting there, too. We were all tired and too scared to turn around and go back. The cops told us that if we waited and were peaceable they would let us through. So we're sitting there and chanting. The people outside the barricade were calling for us to be let go. </p><p>Lois Sutch
Unfortunately the girl's tatoo may be telling a different story....(Gang Tat)  If someone was asking for help, no mattter how distraught they may be I do not believe the RCMP would handcuff her, why would they unless she was fighting arrest....... there is more to this story than meets the eye....... especially the tat above her eye.</p><p>Huffington Post commenters—this would ruin the fun entirely.</p><p>Susan Crockett
Lois, just because one has a tattoo does not automatically make them a criminal. It's 2011. Almost every one has ink or some form of body modification. Even you. So don't judge based on looks. As for the RCMP, seems they like to overstep their boundaries. It's no longer about being patriotic and protecting the people of Canada. It seems to be about the quota for that month, or some sort of jealousy. It's a horrible time when people are more afraid of the police than gangs.</p><p>grimlock
I never needed the help of the police before, All of my encounters with them have been very unpleasant, most are power trippers and have lack of discretion. My advice avoid them like the plague and you'll be fine. These guys are harming civilian's more than the criminals, just give the crook your money and you'll be fine. These guys beat you up, taser you to death and kill you. Not one has ever been fired.</p><p>Veterans Tanner Wright and Ben King each scored twice against the Knights, singles going to Tanner Brown and Rowan Miller.</p><p>We got to One Police Plaza and they kept counting and recounting us in the bus for 45 minutes.

The Police have an obligation to treat everyone respectfully whether they "deserve" it or not. At no time should we tolerate the police using excessive force because someone is talking to them disrespectfully. The Police are a SERVICE and they SERVE the public who PAYS for them. The public is the BOSS, not the Police. If we forget this we are in danger. It also seems to be true that stories of police violence and abuse are on the increase and this must stop now. Yes, I know there are very violent criminals out there, but that's not what we are talking about here.</p><p>peter in MB
I won't offer judgement here either. But as a gentleman that would never hit a lady I hope theses questions are asked of the officers in court. This 17 year old came to you asking for help because she said she was being chased by outlaw gang members.  Why did you put her in hand cuffs? Why did you feel the need to punch her in the face when her hands we cuffed behind her back? As someone with a black belt I know that if someone attacks you have the right to use reasonable force in self defence to subdue them. IE they have a knife or other weapon. But when their hands are cuffed behind their back and you punch them rapidity in the face that is just plain assault!!!  Why did you that it sir? That what needs to be asked.</p><p>The Lakers dominated the shots in the first period as they peppered goalie Bailey Berndt, who was stellar.</p><p>Someone cuffs these kids. Their crime?

This translated to getting cuffed and threatened with imprisonment because in the mind of the child, these things are one in the same. In the mind of a parent any punishment is too much for their kid.</p><p>"He says he hasn't been back to the protests since Saturday for fear of being arrested". Sounds like, despite all his complaints, the police did their job effectively.</p><p>Scientology</p><img src='http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/08/26/article-1049021-0269A3B100000578-358_468x572.jpg' /><p>Scientology</p><p>By Jen Doll</p><p>SAM
All my adult life I've had nothing but respect for the RCMP.  I'm becoming increasingly alarmed at the amount of corruption and rough handling that we're always now hearing about in the RCMP.  I had my own experience with a local RCMP officer in my town whose wife used his reputation to intimidate me and then he set me up with a radar with 3 minutes of my conversation with  her.  I now struggle with having that same respect I once had for the RCMP.</p><p>Neil
I thought the RCMP had academic and psych. requirements in order to become a police officer.  Oh well, I guess we shouldn't be surprised by their actions.  Policing/law enforcement was historically an undesirable job and was (usually) an occupation filled by those that could not obtain a higher education.  It is good too see that 150 years hasn't changed anything.</p><p>We didn't know which way to go.

Sam & Mark, I couldn't agree more. If this is true, we need to seriously think about returning back to the old ways of officer training. 2 years... Anything less and we're not teaching anyone how to be an officer, we're giving *thugs* the legal right to abuse. There is always going to be corruption, regardless of what organization/job sector you are in but it seems that in the last 15 years, the RCMP have really lowered the bar!!</p><p>Haller admits she became angry and started kicking the cruiser's window. </p><p>Runnin' Scared: Can you tell me what happened to you on Saturday? 
We started around 12 or 12:30 in Zuccotti Park, which was renamed Liberty Park by the protesters. We started making our way up -- I wasn't paying attention to exactly what streets, but we made a lot of twists and turns based on which streets cops barricaded and where they led us. We made it to a couple blocks below Union Square when the police formed a line and split off the protest into two separate groups. There was one group of a couple hundred people, one of closer to a thousand people [ed: Numbers have not been confirmed at this time]. I was part of the bigger group that made it to Union Square. People were joining us all the way up, it was totally peaceful. We were just doing what protesters do in a march. So we made it up to Union Square and made speeches and stuff, and chanted. After a while we decided we all wanted to go home, meaning back to Zuccotti Park. My legs were tired. We started chanting, "Let's go home, let's go home." </p><p>Exactly what laws did he break?
