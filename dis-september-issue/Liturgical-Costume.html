I'd been earlier in the week and been moved to tears by a painting of a child's empty blue jacket. When I told my son about this he wanted us to go as a family, so we did. At 4.00am the following morning he ended his life.</p><p>Norm Argulsky, a retired teacher, had had many wonderful and

It's funny but I was driving through Drouin on the weekend and went past the Anglican church there and realised that Anglicans concentrate of beauty in architecture when they build. Even though that church has been extended it's still a beautiful building. Same with the Anglican church in Leongatha. Just a really fine building. Went to a funeral there once and spent the time admiring it.As to what awakens the spiritual in me... Springtime. The first awakenings after winter.

    </p><p>The St Paul's Cathedral Choir at Evensong. On Thursday, the choir celebrates 120 years since its formation. Photo: Michael Clayton-Jones</p><p>In my home town of Melbourne, Evensong is celebrated at St Paul's Cathedral at 5.10 (during school term) frequently to an almost empty house.  St Paul's is the sort of place that can look empty even when it is full. On occasions, the only attendees at Evensong might be the choir and other functionaries.  This is an abomination.  It is criminal PR neglect. And the risk is that if no one goes, it might be canned. That would be a disaster – a financially rational disaster but a disaster nonetheless.  Evensong is practised less regularly in other cathedrals for example Sydney's is on Thursday at St Andrews.  Perth's St George has one on Sunday.</p><p>Restaurants</p><p>

        </p><p>On the question of transcendence, I had an almost equal moment of transcendence riding away along the full but gently flowing Yarra in the sunset and the gloaming past the G and other city landmarks.  Natural beauty coupled with exercise is the combination that the secular often use to achieve some sense of non logical euphoria.  So it was an evening when the secular and sacred paths to serenity were explored.</p><p>The limits of American power, an in-vogue line of analysis for much of the past decade, will be starkly revealed in the coming days.</p><p>She made the trip north in 1949 to establish a site and was the local monastery's foundress and first superior.</p><p>The irony is that when I speak to some Christians about Evensong they sort of pooh pooh it, arguing that such ceremony is about form not substance.  They are Bible-centric believers for whom the archaic liturgy is a distraction from the text.  I demur.  Part of the power of faith is the excellent methods they have of helping the congregation transcend the daily grind.  Music and architecture can be a legitimate method for reaching an emotional rather than logical state.</p><p>

</p><p>Thanks David.  Some of the resources our farming communities have thrown at their Cathedrals in regional towns and cities is astounding.  They are mighty impressive buildings.</p><p>The Chorale is comprised of individuals from all walks of life
and draws membership from Genesee and four surrounding
counties. Many high school students also offer their talents.</p><p>A scrapbook containing photographs and mementos from her century-long life hints at the nun's personality prior to taking her vows. On a card she scrawled, "To my darling mother and dad from their naughty daughter."</p><p>But there is a more important question about ritual and culture.  Faiths are great at ritual and culture.  In ritual you get a group gathering together and celebrating in a non verbal manner that is uplifting.  With culture you get a social continuity that has meaning for any society.  Atheists struggle in these areas.</p><p>The Texans have signed running back James Davis to their practice squad.

Someone once asked how the Great Depression, which brought economic destruction to the nation in the 1930s, was impacting life at the monastery. Mother Teresa Margaret responded: "There's no depression here. Everybody's so happy."</p><p>The Board of Directors is recognizing the tremendous
contributions of the Rotary Club of Batavia for demonstrating
Rotary’s “Service Above Self” motto with the local cultural
community. Noted for their 63 years of annual theatrical
productions, members of Rotary Club consistently participate in,
volunteer for and support cultural programs in our community.</p><p>

of music in various styles from motets and madrigals of the
Renaissance to modern folk, musicals and jazz.  Also included are
larger liturgical settings such as Bach’s St. Matthew’s Passion,
Charpentier’s Midnight Mass for Christmas, the Mozart and Brahm’s
Requiems and several masses by composers such as Schubert and
Mozart.</p><p>TUESDAY NIGHT UPDATE!  Well I attended Evensong last night and was even more convinced of its beauty and worth.  The choir was extraordinary under the baton of Dr June Nixon AM (whose arrangement of Holly and the Ivy for KC can be seen for here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDaxz3GImRc). </p><p>Please check the following fields before continuing:</p><p>Her father traveled to the western Michigan city on business, and his trips made the destination seem more familiar.</p><p>Wednesday, September 28, 2011</p><img src='http://s10.thisnext.com/media/largest_dimension/5B7079B6.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='namgar-punk.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='latte-art-best.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
