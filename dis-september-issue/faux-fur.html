I ditched the leather jackets years ago, wouldnt want to wear a fake leather one now, for the reasons you mention.</p><p> Royal Canada Tour</p><p> Street Style</p><p> Announcements</p><p>Good for her, doesn’t fake fur manufacturing use petroleum and whatnot, which is bad for the environment?  Besides, I’ve never understood why anyone who is against fur would want to wear something that looks just like it.  (I certainly never have or will.)  How are people supposed to know it’s not real?  Seems to me that wearing fake fur helps the continued popularity of the real thing.  And since they look so similar, people that wear the real thing can just lie and say it’s fake.  A better idea would be to promote cruelty-free fashions that look nothing like fur.</p><p>webmaster@nwsource.com</p><p>Michael Kors</p><p> Royal Wedding 2011</p><p>

Tinyâs cream Frozen City Vest ($258 at Anthropologie) hints at vintage elegance with its silk lining, but stays modern with a two-toned faux finish. Even better? This piece is reversible: Turn inside-out for a quilted pattern alternative, and stay warm with now-fur lining.</p><p> Eco-friendly Fashion</p><p> Gifts & Treats</p><p>The Statement PieceFor a look that makes a lasting impression, faux fur-laden jackets and vests are the obvious choice. With or without sleeves, these pieces are easy to pair with midi skirts, the seasonâs best denim or your favorite metallic piece. In other words, whatever your little heart desires.</p><p> Where To Buy...</p><p>

					</p><p> London Fashion Week</p><p> BAFTA Awards</p><p>The weatherâs getting cooler, and before we know it, itâll be time to layer it on for real. Or -- in this case -- for faux. While furâs all the rage this season, the actual stuff isnât always obtainable, or within our Seattle sensibilities. The solution? We searched Seattle stores for faux pieces with real style. From hats and vests to bags and booties, youâll be strutting the streets in head-to-toe chic, minus the hefty price tag. </p><p> Pick Of The Week - Designer Indulgence</p><p> Shopping Guides</p><p>Mail (will not be published) (required)</p><img src='http://www.garmentcare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/faux-fur-1.jpeg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='DISTASTE(Fall-Looks).html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='zentai-in-fur.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
