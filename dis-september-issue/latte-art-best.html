Canadian Cup Tasters Championship
</p><p>Featured Reads</p><p>World Watcher</p><p>Making a decent cup of coffee is not simply about boiling the kettle and pouring some hot water over some ground coffee. No siree. The baristas of this world have turned the art of coffee making into a veritable art form. Latte art, signature drinks and technical know-how all go to raise the bar higher than ever. And in Vietnam, the best of the best will be competing to become the champion of the Vietnam Barista Competition later in the month.</p><p>Tasteful design decisions at this sleek and contemporary shop extend to the delicious espresso drinks: Imagine cappuccinos and macchiatos with picture-perfect foam art. A second location near Logan Circle has extended Peregrine's domain from Capitol Hill and introduced a new part of the city to one of Peregrine's other specialties: pedal-powered bean delivery. Both locations also offer a small selection of Tiffany MacIsaac's sweet treats from Buzz Bakery. With only a handful of seats, a narrow service area and no free WiFi, the 14th Street location is more of a grab-and-go operation; the Eastern Market shop is a better destination for fueling up in front of your laptop.</p><p>Fact Checker</p><p>Comments our editors find particularly useful or relevant are displayed in Top Comments, as are comments by users with these badges: .

On our list of best coffee shops? Filter Coffeehouse and Espresso Bar in Dupont Circle, where  the popular “flat white”  comes with a pillowy layer of foam — perfect stuff for a little latte art. Order it with a spoon of  the shop’s special raw brown sugar, trust us. ( Lavanya Ramanathan/The Washington Post)Early last month, the Food section’s Tim Carman asked readers of the  All We Can Eat blog how they take their coffee — at a chain or at one of the rapidly growing number of indie coffee shops in the area. Readers voted for more than 20 options, from the neighborhood Caribou to Chinatown Coffee, and at the end of the polling, we were left with a list of amazing coffee shops that even we would agree were some of the best around. (Of course, some others, including Tryst, Vienna’s Caffe Amouri deserve honorable mentions, but didn’t rack up quite the same number of votes. And Mid City Caffe, another honorable mention, just announced that it’s closing Oct. 1.)</p><p>WP Social Reader
