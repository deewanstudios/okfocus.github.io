The clot can become stuck in an artery and block flow altogether. In a coronary artery, this can cause myocardial infarction -- a heart attack. In the arteries that provide blood to the brain, the result can be a stroke.</p><p>Marc Lamont Hill, a Democratic pundit and Columbia professor, says New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is "too fat" to be president, repeating a claim he made in 2010.</p><p>According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2010, 34.2 percent of American adults were overweight, 33.8 percent were obese and 5.7 percent were extremely obese. Obesity is measured by the Body Mass Index, expressed as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2), lists a ratio of 25 as the maximum healthy weight. Overweight people have a BMI of 25–29.9 while obesity is greater than or equal to a BMI of 30 and extreme obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 40.</p><p>Heart attacks turned into an American epidemic after World War II, and doctors were baffled to know why.  Intensive research was conducted, and as often happens when the cause of a disease is complex, there was no single reason why men in the vulnerable range for premature heart attacks, from age 40 to 60, were suddenly dying in greater numbers. What had changed in modern society to cause hundreds of thousands of heart attacks a year when in the past, before World War I, a physician might see one patient a month, or fewer, with the symptomatic chest pain known as angina pectoris? An X factor was missing and needed to be identified.   Visualization is courtesy of TheVisualMD.com</p><p>

Anerobic exercise (like weight training) complements aerobic exercise and improves glucose uptake, further aiding small-particle cholesterol reduction.</p><p>As for a 2012 race, Christie has repeatedly stated over the last few months that he's not running for president, going as far as to offer suicide to prove he's serious. But speculation that he's considering jumping in reached a fever pitch last week after Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the GOP frontrunner, stumbled in his third debate appearance, delivering a performance that was widely panned.</p><p>“Imposing an 8pm food curfew can be the key to cutting out evening snacks,” advises Pearson. “Try swapping chocolate for herbal tea or even cleaning your teeth after dinner.” </p><p>When an arterial lesion forms, macrophages -- cells of the immune system -- come to the site of injury as part of the body's inflammatory (healing) response. Together with cholesterol and other lipids, connective tissue, calcium and various other substances, they form a plaque inside the wall of the artery. An arterial plaque is essentially a scab formed to prevent blood loss, just like a scab on the surface of your skin.</p><p>Weekdays 7p et</p><p>2. Stress plays a major factor in heart attacks. Indeed, several wide studies that are considered among the best in the world found stronger psychological correlations to early heart attack than physical ones. Strikingly, men who deal with their psychological issues in their 20s are less likely to suffer premature heart attacks. This was known 50 years ago but was slow to catch on, perhaps since cardiologists are experts in drugs and surgery, not psychology.</p><p>You're logged in as Account</p><p>For more information go to deepakchopra.com</p><p>We like to make your life easier</p><p>Share your Comment:</p><p>Weekdays 9a et</p><p>You are here:

Always avoid raw foods when stressed as the body requires far more energy to break them down. </p><p>FOCUS ON YOUR FOOD </p><img src='http://walkingtowel.org/images/fatman_before_and_after.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='chair-bed-delux.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='waist.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
