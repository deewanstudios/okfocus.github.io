“To be on the set with one of the greatest living actors and watching him work 
  is really, really thrilling,” she says, as breathlessly as someone who's 
  just starting out.

“When Rachel's called upon to defend herself again, she's far from a credible 
  fighter,” she adds, before laughing and referring to the scene as a 
  “geriatric fight between a 60-year-old woman and a 80-year-old man. It's 
  really hard to get back up once you're down,” she hoots.

She's currently promoting her latest film, The Debt, a two-tiered espionage 
  thriller about three retired Mossad agents who have been venerated for 
  decades by Israel because of a secret mission they embarked on in the 
  Sixties.

Mirren has never been one to shy away from stripping off on screen. Perhaps 
  Russell Brand, her co-star on the remake of Arthur, put it best when he 
  described her as: “Our punk queen. She's got a matriarchal authority but 
  she's very, very sexy.”
</p><p>
Mirren responded immediately to the challenges posed by the material.

Every week or so someone drops by that very old post to leave me a comment saying some iteration of "Stop being such a hater! You're just jealous! If you had her body you'd flaunt it too! Women are allowed to be sexy!" I hate the "you're just jealous" argument because it stops all further discussion with a character assassination. There isn't any point in discussing social mores or sexual politics or how women are treated in our society when you write off all opinion as jealousy. And also, it just isn't true.</p><p>

</p><p>Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group</p><p>That;s a very nice Harris, right there!</p><p>3. And I wouldn't flaunt it even if I had it. First, it's against my religion. My LDS faith has guidelines about what needs to be covered, and I adhere to them. Nobody makes me do it, it's something I've chosen to do. I don't feel stifled or repressed, rather I feel more comfortable and more like myself. Second I think it is a disservice to all women to use sex as our primary source of power. It reduces us to a single aspect of our being and marginalizes all our other talents.</p><p>

She's doing herself a disservice, of course, because in the flesh she looks 
  remarkable and effortlessly elegant in a light green dress and cream jacket, 
  her silver hair styled in a soft bob.
</p><p>This issue of beautiful women showing their bits to make money has been covered more times than "Let it Be," so why did this story spark such an interest for me? Because of the way people are reacting to Graham's reasoning. He could have said that he kicked her out of his field for trampling his crops, being a distraction or even for not paying him but instead he told the truth: he was uncomfortable with her style of (un)dress and considered it inappropriate. He didn't tell her to cover up. He didn't call her a slut. He didn't tell her she was going to hell. He didn't say anything except how he felt. And how he felt was uncomfortable. Whether or not you agree with his assessment -- and for the record, I didn't find Rihanna's outfit in this case to be particularly shocking, especially given the standard for women in music videos; I was more appalled that she was smoking -- I think he was very brave to share it.</p><p>

Then she laughs and says that her husband, director Taylor Hackford, is

In a recent interview she said she thought there was a sense of shock that a

  don't actually look like that, I just cover it up well.”

And indeed she's always been lauded for her physical attributes and barely 
  latent sexuality during her 40-year career.
