</p><p>At home later, Mike is ignoring Molly’s suggestions about wedding locations while he watches TV. She wants to go looking for reception locations over the weekend but Mike says he’s going on his trip. It’s Vince that actually pipes up telling Mike that he should at least give Molly the courtesy of informing her about his plans in advance and be engaged in the wedding decision process. Take that, Mike.</p><p>

Limelight Listing - Ryan Reynolds...
</p><p>Home of the San Francisco Chronicle</p><p>Nike and Gap also are following Lululemon's practice of tapping into yoga's spiritual ethos, an effort to make customers feel that they're part of a community. Athleta's website features a Chi blog as well as a series of Zen webinars. </p><p>Billy Gardell’s Mike remains a lesser Ralph Kramden knock-off. The writer’s don’t know how to keep him consistent as they have him in one episode totally besotted by Molly and in the next (like this one) being a surly jerk that doesn’t even act like he wants to be in a relationship. It’s poor character consistency that relegates him firmly in the two-dimensional, fat-guy role. As for the rest of the cast, they do what they do. No one is particularly a standout, but again that’s more a function of the show and the writing.</p><p>

Joyce suggests attending her yoga class to de-stress and Molly reluctantly is talked into it. That basically devolves into an excuse to get Melissa McCarthy twisted into positions with her hunky Yoga instructor. Joyce snaps a picture and sends it to Vince, who shows it to Mike. Upset, Mike drags his soggy friends home and then apologizes to Molly for being boorish and uninterested.</p><p>Gross margins are strong and have increased, from 63.5% to 65.5%.
