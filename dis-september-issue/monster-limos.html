But in the meantime, go forth and dance.</p><p>To view this site, you need to have Flash Player 9.0.115 or later installed. Click here to get the latest Flash player.</p><p>As you have either heard or divined already, Grace had an  upper wardrobe containment failure at the end of her dance this week. It went  out in the East Coast broadcasts, and it sure as blazes went out over the internet. Grace seems like a fairly straight-laced woman – oh, let’s  be honest: She’s a seething ball of intertwined repressions and resentments –  and I’m guessing that being exposed that way was excruciating for her. And so now pictures of her nipple that she didn’t want to  reveal are all over the Internet and no matter what she does personally or  professionally for the rest of her life they’ll be out there, a Google search  away.</p><p>Solo and her partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy had a great  time springing all over the stage, but J.R. Martinez and Karina  Smirnoff had the most impressive moves – they were in sync, did a great  lift and flippy thing (For which they were penalized!) and jumped all  over the place.</p><p>Personal to Rob Kardashian: You don’t need to be on  television. There are other things to be. There are lots of ways to live a  happy, fulfilling, non-televised life in this world. In fact, you have a phenomenal advantage in life. Millions  of people – literal millions – work jobs they hate day after day just to put  food on the table, and in between those workdays they work like hell to try to  carve out few scraps of time around the edges to do what they love and nurture  the people they care about. You, Rob, have the family wealth and whatever reality TV  money you’ve managed to squirrel away to fall back on. You have the luxury of  trying your hand at absolutely anything in this world that you want.</p><p>Feelings, Feelings, Feelings!</p><p>Ricki Lake and Derek Hough did a backbend to  the floor, not to mention some jaw-dropping grinding. Lake won me over this  week. She has the guts and determination of a real scrapper, and she seemed to  be having a lot of fun. My early, completely uninformed prediction is that she  and Martinez will be two of the three finalists.</p><p>Ah, well, at least he finally has a shot to get out from  under his talent-free, pointlessly famous sisters’ shadows and be talent-free  and pointlessly famous in his own right! God, it’s almost impossible not to  root for the guy! And yet somehow I manage.</p><img src='http://wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/obama-ride.jpg' /><p>Ah, well, at least he finally has a shot to get out from  under his talent-free, pointlessly famous sisters’ shadows and be talent-free  and pointlessly famous in his own right! God, it’s almost impossible not to  root for the guy! And yet somehow I manage.</p><p>Think well, Rob Kardashian: Has randomly, pointlessly being  on television and constantly groping for yet more undeserved fame turned anyone  in your family into a better person? You don’t have to be a monster, Rob. Leave the show. Save  yourself and be happy.</p><p>Still, Hope Solo did her best to keep the flame alive.</p><p>So on that count, I feel bad for Nancy Grace, as a woman and  a fellow human being. On the other hand, she is Nancy Grace. And she has made her living screaming at people on TV and  doing shows for months on end that work under the assumption that the targets  of her nationally broadcast television show are guilty without trial, and then  cementing that impression with her viewers.</p><p>And, as you’ve noticed, in our messed-up culture if a man  has naked pictures on the internet, oh, well, they’re just out there, but if a  woman has nude pictures published the world thinks it has taken something away  from her. Ha, ha, she’s diminished, on the losing end, and by definition  weaker. The world won something from her, and she wasn’t even playing.</p><p>Yes, there was another incident that involved showing some  skin. We’ll get to that in a moment.</p><p>Also there may or may not have been a professional-dancy  portion during which Demi Lovato sang “Skyscraper” while two dancers kept  trying to pull each other off a ladder and then some more dancers fought over  getting up a staircase.</p><p>Style By Jury: Do You Prefer Leighton Meester With Or Without Bangs?</p><p>And, yes, another thing happened. We’ll get to it in a  minute.</p><img src='http://www.limofinder.com.au/images/monster-limo.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='DC-fashion-week.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='sarah-palin-alaska.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
