            body dissatisfaction, body image, fat talk, girlfriend, girlfriend conversation, women        </p><p>In Salk and Englen-Maddoxs study, an overwhelming 93% of participants admitted engaging in such talk.  Interestingly, many of these women felt that they participated in it less than other women did, and that they only did so to make the other woman feel better.  A typical script may look like this:</p><p>I see this all the time on the college campus where I teach, and while I used to just pass it off as another form of female bonding, I began to ask myself if I wanted to bond over body dysmorphia. No. I dont, and yet I find myself almost automatically saying the expected thing. I have to force myself to stop, and try to turn it around by saying I think you are beautiful, no matter your size.  And if you cant fit into those jeans, then it is the jeans that are the problem, and not your butt.</p><p>40 percent of male subjects and 51 percent of female subjects believed that the fourth female would self-degrade her body.  This means that women normalize their own body dissatisfaction and that self-degradation is predictable. </p><p>I'm going to try it - a week without 'fat talk'! In fact, a week without putting myself down at all. If I find something I'd like to change, I'll work on it. If I spend the time I'd normally spend moaning on exercise, then I'll have no need to indulge in 'fat talk'. Wish me luck!</p><p>
