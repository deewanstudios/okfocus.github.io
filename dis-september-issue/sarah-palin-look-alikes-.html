This difference is that PAUL HAS A HUGE GRASS  ROOTS FOLLOWING…michelle bachman is little more than a media puppet! Ron Paul has a chance to win the Republican nomination, Bachman has none. Simple as that.  The media so hates Paul that it will not mention him with mentioning bachman…fine…doesnt matter, Paul is making strong headway because of his followers who are devoted and extremely motivated. Simply put they DONT WANT ANYMORE WARS COSTING THIS NATION TRILLIONS! I mean there is simply no reason for the Media to ignore this sentiment! Get real! These wars have been destructive, and they are destroying the credibility of the media itself…and Ron Paul simply embodies all that protest! I really dont see what these people in the media hierarchy dont understand here..did they think that the US media simply belonged to them? This is fact in my opinion, then again, I admit sometimes I see things my way and fail to see other ways…c’est la vie</p><p>Andrea Mogil, who has a pie shop in Juneau and doesn't own a TV, remembers hearing about Palin's activities four years ago on the radio and in papers. Parnell, she said, doesn't have the same visibility. "It hasn't even occurred to me that he's jockeying for another position," she said.</p><p>Yet, if Brisket simply said, “Yes, I am a randy little tart.,” there would be no punch in the book, would there?</p><p>For the last 36 hours MSNBC, led by the champion on of all poverty pimps, the so-called “reverend” not-so-sharp-tool Al, have been railing about the execution of this guy who has been found GUILTY by a jury of his peers, according to the law.</p><p>For Some Damn Reason, Lawrence O’Donnell Has Levi Johnston As A Guest On His Show</p><p>Speaking to In Touch Weekly magazine, Levi discussed the onslaught of Palin books, the craziest offer he’s gotten and the prospect of President Sarah Palin.</p><p>Sick bastards, all of them.</p><p>odonnell seems a little sick to have someone reads him stories about underage sex</p><p>There are major differences between Palin and Parnell: she has a charisma that attracts huge crowds and media attention; conservatives she met when they cruised into Juneau four years ago reportedly swooned. Meanwhile, the normally low-key Parnell can walk through crowds in Juneau with little notice. A key piece of Parnell's legislative agenda is overhauling the oil tax system that is part of Palin's legacy.</p><p>Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes Take Suri For Milkshakes!</p><p>Watch:  'Incendiary' Filmmakers on 'Top Line'</p><p>

This earless little Idot O’Donnell is not worth the effort is would take to insult
him this morning!
I would bet good money that if he was not yankin off during the interview that
he took care of that within minutes after the interview!
But all MSNBC hosts will have Levi on.

    </p><p>If this so-called “reverend” is so hung up about the value of human life, if he is so righteous about ending a life of a person who may or may not be guilty as convicted and sentenced, would he be just as righteous and indignant  at every human slaughter-house commonly known and frequented by sluts as abortion clinic, where ALL LIVES extinguished are – beyond ANY doubt – are INNOCENT???</p><p>

Parnell has been perhaps more assertive on the issue of state and federal relations than any other Alaska governor, McBeath said, pushing the feds — who own most in Alaska— to not overregulate and to allow more development.</p><p>I’m sorry but I think the “blogger” is just as full of bullshit as Beck and Limbaugh….don’t believe any of them in anything they say.</p><p>“Mainstream republicans enjoy bombing people oversees.

But with liberals a small sliver of the Republican Party, Bachmann’s advantage among core Republican constituencies is more of an advantage in the primary season. (In another example, Paul’s unfavorability rating among Democrats is 14 points lower than Bachmann’s.)</p><p>Gary Langer provides public opinion polling, analysis and consulting services to ABC News through Langer Research Associates, a company he founded in 2010 after more than a decade as ABC's polling director.</p><p>“Half a million dollars to masturbate on camera and do a porno with the Sarah Palin look-alike who did Nailin’ Palin.

It’s crazy!”</p><p>As Palin is out to make money, so is Creepy Larry out to make money by way of spending all this airtime on her.  More Sarah = more ratings = more money.  Who’s the money whore, Larry?</p><p>The overall message Parnell is carrying — reduce reliance on foreign oil by drilling at home — has been a mantra for state leaders for years. Parnell has been speaking to it since taking over for Palin when she resigned in July 2009.</p><p>I can think of a website that also is silent on Solyndra but can’t run enough stories on Levi Johnston — and Trig and Bristol too.</p><p>“I did read Sarah’s book, Going Rogue.
