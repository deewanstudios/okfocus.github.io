They consistently pushed tempo, got their teammates involved and showed the ability to lead even with older players surrounding them.
</p><p>Most Sent »</p><p>At the start of Ron Unz’s essay, he offers an intriguing hypothesis on how racial polarization shapes political contestation in the U.S. I first encountered the idea that there are “natural antagonisms” in our politics in the work of Kevin Phillips, the left-wing populist who was, much earlier in his career, a right-wing populist. That is, there are groups that will not sit comfortably in the same political coalition, for a variety of reasons that include but are not limited to prejudice, historical experience, and labor market competition, all of which intertwine. </p><p>

</p><p>By contrast, although relations between whites and various other groups—Asians, Hispanics, and American Indians—have sometimes been hostile or even violent, these conflicts have never been nearly as long nor intense and are more like the often contentious relationships between various white ethnic groups. As our schoolbooks endlessly emphasize, black/white relations do indeed constitute a unique aspect of American history.</p><p>

                      </p><p>Most of the conservatives who believe, like Unz, that anti-immigration rhetoric can prove costly over the long-term thus embrace a comprehensive immigration reform agenda that includes a path to citizenship, etc. But Unz does not. Rather, he offers a distinctive solution. Before he gets there, however, he offers a case against mass immigration that has very little to do with the cultural concerns that are typically raised by paleoconservatives, but rather with the impact of less-skilled U.S. workers, including recent immigrants and Americans of Mexican origin, and to a lesser extent with the environmental consequences. I’ll discuss this aspect of Unz’s argument in the next post.</p><p>

Furthermore, the original white colonists and plantation elites historically had had a quite conflicted relationship both with the Native Hawaiian population whose leadership they supplanted and also with the large numbers of Japanese, Chinese, and other Asian workers originally imported as impoverished plantation laborers.</p><p>Already Registered?

But the least white state of all has actually projected a very different cultural image.</p><p>
Perhaps the biggest evidence of the importance of such events, from a player development perspective, was the performance of Courtney Ekmark of Phoenix, Ariz.  The unassuming 6-foot wing from the class of 2014 has established herself as one of the premier shooters in the country over the last two years, but much has been said about her needing add strength and develop her ballhandling.

</p><p>In true all-star fashion, some of the more skilled scorers, like Danielle Ballard of Memphis, Tenn.; N'Dea Bryant of Goose Creek, S.C.; Alexis Brown of Suwanee, Ga., and Te'a Cooper of Powder Springs, Ga., used stretches of the 5-on-5 action to entertain the spectators and remind everyone how special the sport's best players can be.

“So Indochine’s latest incarnation is no big shock,” Mr. Greenfield-Sanders said. “I’ve always believed that, aside from the very decent food there, the reasons artists loved it so much was because the floors are so damned stylish. Who can resist checkerboard black-and-white?”        </p><p>
Ekmark, a sophomore at St. Mary's High School (Phoenix, Ariz.), utilized a multitude of combination moves off the dribble, setting up not only her pretty jumper, but also getting to the rim.  Such play came against other elite players in a competitive environment, which isn't always the case during club or high-school games.  Ekmark showed the willingness to challenge herself in pursuit of reaching her potential by testing her limits.

      			</p><p>Yet although the local Republican Party has generally skewed toward the 25 percent of the population that is white, while the Democrats have been more popular among the majority Asians, the state’s reputation has overwhelmingly been one of easygoing race relations, a high degree of intermarriage, and a complete lack of vicious political conflict. Ideologically, Hawaii’s white minority seems to think and vote much more like the racially liberal residents of 95 percent white Vermont than as members of a racially polarized minority bloc, locked in endless political struggle with its non-white opponents.</p><p>There is no logical contradiction between the powerful backlash of California whites against immigrants 20 years ago and the apparent lack of such political sentiments today. In the early 1990s, the state’s demographics had just undergone a period of very rapid change, and middle-class whites were naturally fearful and alarmed about the consequences of these changes and the possible behavior of so many millions of new immigrants from such different backgrounds, especially in the immediate aftermath of the deadly Rodney King riots. This left them easy targets for political demagoguery. But after a few years had gone by, most whites concluded that their new neighbors seemed like pretty reasonable people, not too different from themselves, and racial concerns dropped to the lower levels of most public opinion surveys, usually ranking below jobs, housing, healthcare, and sometimes even traffic.</p><img src='http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users16/xgeorgiagirlx/default/model-wallpaper--large-msg-122702731783.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='outsourcing.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='chatting-on-phone.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
