ocean and beach theme throughout its construction. The casino, the
hotel lobby, the restaurants, a rooftop garden, the outdoor pools
and the cabanas all will overlook the beach. Even the casino's
curvy glass facade that hovers over the Boardwalk appears as though
it were sculpted by waves.</p><p>But you don't have to be part of the jet-set to enjoy its attractions, as Gareth Huw Davies discovered.</p><p>We enjoyed a couple of days lying on sunloungers next to the large freshwater pool, within a landscape garden planted with palm trees and herbs, used in the hotel’s cooking.</p><p>Temperature: 13 C to 26 C</p><p>

It's just 21 miles from the airport – and these days it is such a rare pleasure to check in to your hotel an hour after you clear immigration. The town itself is a handsome, shimmering vision on a hot morning, with ranks of white stucco houses and bougainvillea climbing a hill above the deep blue of two bays.</p><p>We are no longer accepting comments on this article.</p><p>Submit your public events here</p><p>By night, it basks in the glow of the lit-up St Peter's Castle, home of the Museum of Underwater Archaeology. Here they display wondrous riches recovered from 3,000 years of shipwrecks in these coastal waters. Look for the fabulous gold seal of Queen Nefertiti, from the famous 14th Century BC Uluburun shipwreck. The ship was found in 1982 close to Bodrum, 120ft down, with enough metal aboard to make weapons for an entire army. More details at www.bodrum-museum.com.

Associates, and other environmental experts from The Richard
Stockton College of New Jersey to devise ways to build up the
shoreline. The process began to unfold when the Army Corps started
to replenish the city's beaches a few months ago. The dunes also
will be strengthened as part of the beach replenishment.</p><p>Discovered in 1962 by a farmer cultivating his vegetables, the mosaic floors of four Roman villas are on an Unesco World Heritage protected archaeological park, where you can also see a partly restored Roman Odeon.</p><p>Tantalising items on the menu include a caviar and pearl facial and green coffee or aromatic Moor Mud wraps.

the notoriously strong ocean storms from washing away the
replenished beaches.</p><p>
