Dzine (born Carlos Rolon) brought low-rider sounds and plenty of bling, along with a chandelier of Swarovski crystals, to the gallery’s Freeman Alley space, where artists such as Fab 5 Freddy and Luis Gispert watched a manicurist apply tiny versions of Dzine’s glittering objects to willing pinkies. “This is a social project, not a nail salon,” said dealer Jeanne Greenberg Rohaytn, though it looked mighty like a nail salon and in fact was called “Imperial Nail Salon.” Alas, it was only sculpture.</p><p>Getty Museum to Return More Artifacts to Greece</p><p>Wallis Annenberg and Laurent Degryse Join MoCA Board</p><p>By Saturday night, it felt as if the art world was settling into itself. Cave showed an outrageous group of new assemblages at Mary Boone that were as theatrical and buzzing as Keren Cytter’s new videos at Zach Feuer were brainy and sober. More surprises were waiting at Algus Greenspon, where the mortal coil provided the central theme for a fascinating show that combined nineteenth-century Romantic and Symbolist paintings, prints, and photographs with twenty-first-century drawings and paintings. “All this stuff is out there,” Algus said of the historical works, which he had found in the drawers of galleries uptown. “It’s just that no one ever brings them down here.”</p><p>“Three Artists: Guo Gai, Meng Tang, Slinko”</p><p>Left: Artist Luis Gispert with Fab 5 Freddy.

Bomb squads roamed the streets, and helmeted cops armed with machine guns were on patrol everywhere but in the art world, where an unmistakable back-to-school optimism emanated from crowds spilling out of galleries under a waxing moon.</p><p>Benjamin Saurer</p><p>Luke Stettner</p><p>Left: Artists Charline von Heyl and Nicola Tyson.
