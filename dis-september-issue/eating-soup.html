To make the pastries, preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and line a baking 
  sheet with silicone baking paper. Cut the pastry in two and roll each half 
  into a rectangle that roughly fits the baking sheet. Lay one piece on the 
  sheet. Chop or crumble the cheese and scatter over the pastry base. Brush 
  the edges with the egg glaze and lay the second piece of pastry on top. 
  Press down lightly with your hands to seal, then trim to a neatish rectangle 
  and brush all over with glaze. Score small slits in the surface using a 
  sharp knife. Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden. Before serving, cut into 
  slices.

Eat the soup, ladled into bowls and drizzled with oil if desired, with the 
  warm pastries on the side. 
</p><p>And you can feel good about eating soup because it's naturally good for you, especially when homemade. When packed with vitamins, nutrients, fiber, protein and carbs, it can pile on more nourishment in a single bowl than many more complex meals.</p><p>Humidity: 61%</p><p>
But my favorite part is that soup can help you take off weight and keep it off. That's because eating soup can help you feel full while eating fewer calories, which is key to long-term weight-loss success. The reason — soup (obviously not cream soups!) is considered a low energy-dense food, which means it provides more food for fewer calories, so you ultimately feel fuller.</p><p>Letter: Proper etiquette for eating soup was not mentioned</p><p>For all sorts of reasons, soup tops my list of quick and convenient meals.</p><p>
