I'm not kidding. He would only let her buy certain labels, in certain colours. He told her that what she wore defined them as a couple. I'm still not kidding. So she was confined to the clean lines of Helmut Lang and Marni in black, white and grey. When she broke ranks and wore a pink dress to a BBQ he went crazy, ripped it off her and cut it to shreds with scissors. She endured another six more months with this serial killer in waiting before she finally had the gumption to leave. Later she put all the clothes from that period of her life on eBay and I haven't seen her wear black since.</p><p>You are logged in as
