It takes a very special perspective to understand what a personal assistant to the rich and famous does, and having worn that hat before is essential to realizing what kind of thick skin and perseverance it takes.  The fact is that personal assistants are no longer just errand runners.  Celebrity PAs play a very active role in managing the day-to-day business operations of the VIP’s life and image, and that’s why elite assistants are sometimes referred to as “Lifestyle Managers”.  They manage yachts, exotic car fleets, private jets, household staff, and extensive calendars – both personal and professional. </p><p>
“It is also a low-skilled sport that has a physical steadiness so once you are 
  running you can allow your mind to wander and clear – which is different to 
  a strategy sport such as football, which requires focus on the ball,” 
  explains Cowie. 
</p><p>
It’s not just serious athletes such as Yelling who can benefit in this way. 
  While all types of exercise are thought to help reduce stress, it seems that 
  running – for two miles or 26 – has a particularly beneficial effect on 
  mental health. Research suggests it can boost mood, confidence and 
  self-esteem and may even help in the long term with serious depression.

“If you’re running with someone you can talk intermittently – but because 
  you’re not face to face there’s no pressure,” says London-based personal 
  trainer Anna Cash (www.londonpersonaltrainers.com), 
  whose favourite loop is around leafy Dulwich Park. 
</p><p>New York, NY (PRWEB) September 28, 2011 </p><p>Brian Daniel focuses on establishing long-lasting and professional relationships with his clients, so he’s not just looking to score a commission like most employment agents and recruiters.  The Celebrity Personal Assistant Network is truly a boutique employment agency that always strives for 5-star concierge service.  Additionally, Brian Daniel is known for his exhaustive qualification process that completely eclipses other headhunters in the industry.  </p><p>
Then there’s the social aspect. While some find that running alone helps clear 
  the mind, others get a buzz from having company – whether it be in the form 
  of a running club or just a friend.

Of course, many types of exercise can have a similar effect, says Dr Charlotte 
  Cowie, orthopaedic physician at the Bupa Centre, Barbican, London. “However, 
  running is so universal – you can do it anywhere, any time.
</p><p> The Celebrity Personal Assistant Network places personal assistants with celebrities, executives, and high net worth families; and now serves all U.S. markets including but not limited to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Chicago, New York City, Washington DC, and Miami.

“The result of feeling calmer doesn’t just last for the time of the run but 
  can affect your whole week – particularly if you run regularly – helping you 
  feel more in control and emotionally stronger.”
