company in the MSCI World except Tokyo Electric Power Co., which
owned the nuclear plant in Fukushima, Japan, that caused the
worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl. </p><p>Once a $20 billion company, Esprit plummeted more than 90
percent in the past four years as Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) and
Inditex SA (ITX)’s Zara lured away customers and prompted the retailer
to say its brand “lost its soul.” Esprit, valued at just $1.4
billion yesterday, sold for 32 cents per dollar of revenue,
cheaper than any apparel company after falling to its lowest
valuation this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Today, the stock surged the most in almost three years. </p><p>(Updates with CIBC comment at end.)</p><p>     Maple made an offer for TMX on May 13, trumping the agreement between the Toronto exchange owner and London Stock Exchange Group Plc. LSE and TMX scrapped the combination on June 29 after failing to get enough shareholder support, leaving Maple as the sole suitor. TMX’s board on July 21 authorized management and advisers to hold discussions with Maple.</p><p>
Seton Hall’s vice president for enrollment management, Alyssa McCloud, said that after students were admitted, “there’s a lot of confusion among families about the bottom-line cost” as they waited to hear from various schools about their aid packages, as well as about any independent scholarships they might be competing for. The discounted tuition for top students, she said, would let “families know right up front what the bottom line will be.”        </p><p>H&M and Zara, which also rely on Europe for most of their
revenue, have fared better. While Esprit’s sales have stagnated
in the past three years, analysts estimate that Stockholm-based
H&M will increase 25 percent this year versus 2008. </p><p>
Rutgers, a public university with more than 40,000 undergraduates on three campuses, charges $10,104 in tuition to in-state undergraduates and $22,766 to out-of-state students, plus room, board and fees that, like Seton Hall’s, amount to about $13,000 a year.        </p><p>     “There’s a great deal of confidence that it’s working its way through the regulatory process and that the Maple Group is quite satisfied,” Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Vice Chairman Jim Prentice told reporters today in Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p><p>     “Whenever you have a transaction like this, there’s a certain amount of regulatory uncertainty,” Kloet, 53, said today in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “That’s a factor and the market’s trying to make a judgment based on that.”</p><p>“It’s so cheap that it might have buyers stepping up,”
said Alvaro Shiraishi, a Denver-based vice president of Cambiar
Investors LLC, which oversees about $8 billion. “The
adjustments they need to make are probably better done when you
are not under scrutiny of a public company.” </p><p>RSS Feed: Most Read Stories</p><p>©2011 Bloomberg L.P.

has become so cheap that it wouldn’t surprise me to see a
private equity firm or another buyer looking at it,” said Jim Nelson, who helps manage $500 million, including Esprit shares,
at Euro Pacific Asset Management in Newport Beach, California.
“Future success will hinge on the company’s ability to turn the
brand around and successfully grow the Asian business.” </p><p>     CIBC, Canada’s fifth-largest bank, is one of the Maple Group members.</p><p>

					</p><p>     Kloet called the London and Maple deals “totally different” and said he was excited about LSE’s proposal because it brought new products, markets and distribution that would be difficult for TMX to create on its own. Maple’s deal builds on TMX’s existing strategy though it includes CDS, a platform Kloet has sought.</p><p>
“The primary motivation has been that as we go through what looks like a double-dip recession, we wanted to help our students,” Seton Hall’s president, Gabriel Esteban, said of the new approach. But in addition, he said, “it probably will help us in attracting a certain quality of students.”        </p><p>
Like many colleges, Seton Hall, a Catholic school in South Orange, N.J., has need-blind admissions: that is, it accepts or rejects students without regard to their ability to pay. But also like many of its peers, it offers more generous financial support to the students it most wants — generally known as merit aid.        </p><p>The murder of Burhanuddin Rabbani dealt a grievous blow to peace in Afghanistan.</p><p>     “Both are interesting, but I like the idea of new products” tied to the LSE bid, Kloet said. “That was pretty exciting for me.”</p><p>“It is still a very well-known brand,” said Gabriel Chan,
an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in Hong Kong. Private
equity could “take over the company and restructure the company
in a more sensible way. It is still worth something. It’s a
matter of how they rejuvenate the brand,” he said. </p><p>Compared with cash flows, Esprit’s stock slumped this week
the lowest level since at least the end of 2002, while the
company also traded at the biggest discount to its assets minus
liabilities in at least 16 years, the data show. </p><p>RSS Feed: Most Discussed Stories</p><img src='http://c.dryicons.com/files/graphics_previews/discount.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='interracial-racial-hand-holding.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='audigier-sexline-golden-girls.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
