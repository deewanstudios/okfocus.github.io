    </p><p>I thought it was pretty cool to see someone going for an armbar from side control, Walburger was going all out for the finish from the start</p><p>Most eateries offer toppings such as dried fruit and cream so customers can customize their oatmeal.</p><p>you should check out Marcelo’s dvd mentioned above, New Game 4. His omo plata from a straight ankle lock is particularly creative. I myself, really enjoy a spider guard omo plata, I call it the out-the-backdoor omo plata cause you momentarily allow them to feel like they are passing to side control and then you pivot underneath them to inverted and BAM. This move wouldn’t be wise to try out in mma though, sleeve grips are pretty crucial.</p><p>This entire flow is an example of what I’ve always heard referred to as the "triple attack". It is done at the gym I train at as part of a warm up if we’re working guard techniques that day and involves the transition between the arm-bar/triangle/omoplata and how to transition between them from within the guard; each of these submissions rely on the isolation of a single arm of your opponent and can be linked together and chained repeatedly when/if one of them fails (barring certain situations where your opponent is able to de-isolate that arm or fundamentally alter the position/pass guard).</p><p>by Matthew Goldstein 15 days ago</p><p>by some schmuck in texas

    </p><p>Another saying oft heard in the sports landscape is the best defense being a good offense. At the most recent Ultimate Fight Night in New Orleans this past weekend T.J. Waldburger had a strong top position which he gave up to go for an armbar attempt and opponent Mike Stumpf did his best to scramble to get out and take a stronger position. Instead of retreating to guard when the initial submission attempt failed, Waldburger did not give up on his offense and showed the value of being able to chain submission attempts together - more commonly known as lock-flows in the grappling arts - to eventually catch Stumpf in a fight ending triangle choke.</p><p>Bilson set a formal hearing on the petition to terminate Lockridge's parental rights for Oct. 11 before Oakland Circuit Judge Joan Young. </p><p>The mat is my church, the ground is my heaven, Jiu-Jitsu is my religion.
