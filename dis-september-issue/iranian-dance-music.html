As you mentioned, Iranians are not good in teamwork. They are individualistic, and they shine in sports like weight lifting, and wrestling. After thirty-three years of miserable life under Jomhoorye Islami, they still cannot cooperate with each other, to change their situation, and make a better life for themselves and their families.
</p><p>The Times, Sep 22, 2011, Updated Sep 22, 2011  </p><p>Iranians as an average, have a general lack of the slightest penchant to ever stand up together, nevermind actually fight good for our collective liberty. Many know this well from our continual soccer hell, and nationally established metaphor, as the lack of the ability to play on a team. </p><p>To read more bahmani posts visit: http://brucebahmani.blogspot.com/</p><p>
