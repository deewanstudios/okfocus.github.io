</p><p>I decided to first try the sugaring paste method, which doesn’t require any additional equipment beyond baby powder to prep the skin. I allowed the solution to sit for a few hours until it cooled to room temperature and hardened to a thick, moldable paste. Tipping the container to the side should make the mixture flow very slowly like molasses. If the consistency is more honey-like, then it didn’t cook long enough. Before putting the sugaring paste anywhere near my skin, I scrubbed and exfoliated my legs in the shower and then applied a layer of baby powder to my first test subject: my shin.</p><p>While on the lookout for a new method of hair removal, I came across sugaring. Unlike waxing, which sticks to any surface where it is applied, sugaring does not adhere to living skin cells and rip them off the body. The sugaring technique minimizes pain by pulling hair in the natural direction of growth, whereas waxing has a high ouch factor in going against the grain. Since wax hardens on the hair, it has the tendency to break it off at the surface, leaving 15-30% breakage behind. Also at odds with wax, sugaring paste is water-soluble and can be easily rinsed off skin or clothes. Though the wax treatment that I most recently tried was composed of all-natural ingredients, most products used for body waxing are made from petroleum-based resins, artificial fragrances, dyes, preservatives, and other potentially allergenic chemicals.</p><p>More affordable and accessible than ever before</p><img src='http://www.natural-hair-colors.com/gifs/hair-color-removal.jpg' /><p>More affordable and accessible than ever before</p><p>This is the first time visual effects, compositing and video editing at this level have been so affordable. HitFilm was showcased by Corridor Digital in their short film ‘Prism’, which has been watched over a million times online, and more filmmakers are discovering the software everyday and joining the HitFilm.com online community.</p><p>My most recent bikini waxing appointment was both painfully long and exceedingly painful. The particular salon that I picked specializes in an all-natural, low-temperature wax that is supposedly favored in Europe. I was intrigued by the benefits of this particular wax for sensitive skin (no burning or irritation) but was unaware of the hour-plus procedure that would be involved (with the esthetician going over each section of skin repeatedly). Maybe that’s acceptable in countries where life moves at a leisurely pace and women are more comfortable with public nudity. But I prefer my waxing appointments short and sweet. And dragging out the excruciating process even a minute longer than absolutely necessary is a deal-breaker in my book.</p><p>Besides being prepared with ingredients that could produce a delicious dessert, the benefits of sugaring extend beyond its pure formula. During application, the sugar paste or gel seeps into the hair follicle, lubricating the hair root for easier removal. Pulling hair out in the same direction of growth lessens strain on the skin and prevents breakage of the hair follicle above or below the skin’s surface. As a result, ingrown hairs don’t form and the surface stays hairless for as long as possible. Over time, when the hairs grow back, they become finer and softer. The skin also gets a bonus smoothing treatment.</p><img src='http://image.made-in-china.com/4f0j00qCJaLptHvgbf/Color-Removal-Agents.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='balinese-fashion.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='pierced-back-dimples.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
