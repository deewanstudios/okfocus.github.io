Both sides are claiming victory in the case involving Hilex Poly of South Carolina and reusable bag manufacturer ChicoBag of Chico, Calif. Hilex Poly challenged statements the smaller company made on its website and in educational materials, including that "a reusable bag needs only to be used eleven times to have a lower environmental impact than using eleven disposable bags" and that "somewhere between 500 billion and a trillion plastic bags are consumed worldwide each year."        </p><p>

Hilex Poly, one of the country's biggest makers of plastic bags, sued ChicoBag earlier this year.        </p><p>
After receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Hilex Poly before the lawsuit, Keller removed the 1 percent figure and other controversial material.        </p><p>Some claim that an anti-overdose drug is not safe.
