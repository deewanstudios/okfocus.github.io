She had one prior to his. Cheap nail salon visit, you know, cause the paps just happen to hang out there.</p><p>Al’s lookin’ kinda shabby there.</p><p>@ladybug: oh, dear… Let me explain it to you:
they have the same publicist and JJ always make posts about them at the same time… it doesn’t matter what they’re doing.
Alex has gas station, eating sandwiches, runing and more ‘nail salon’ equivalent post …</p><p>I think the costume department on this movie is doing a good job making Alex look like a slubby suburban American husband. It’s so funny. I’d still hit that!</p><p>@wtf?: Thumb troll.</p><p>Buy your very own JJ and JJJ t-shirts!</p><p>OMG The comments are priceless:http://www.dlisted.com/2011/09/27/ASkars-Is-Fighting-The-Hot-For-His-Art+

The spokesman for the secretary-general added that the misunderstandings have been resolved, and that prompt action was taken, but he did not elaborate.</p><p>@Pap: So obviously on a movie set, as opposed to say, a nail salon or a vet’s office.</p><p>Actually, two AlexS post and two KateBosworth post… being honest I believe this is no coincidence. The reactions are funny:
- “oooh, a new alex post!”
- “she calls the paps!!!”</p><p>
