This stretches all the way back to his college days at Ohio State. The guy just can't stay healthy and he NEVER plays hurt. This is actually one of my favorite calls of all-time.</p><p>This season, though, I was surprised I was one of the only guys really pushing him. As I stated this summer, Decker had an easy path to the starting job in my opinion. If you look at Decker, he was an unstoppable receiver at Minnesota, despite playing on an awful offense. He showed some promise late last year. Then the Broncos got rid of Jabar Gaffney and Demaryius Thomas was injured, leaving only Eddie Royal for Decker to beat out. That was easy money.</p><p>Now, on with the Fire Sale ...</p><p>Nicks will come down with the ball if it's thrown his way even if he's covered. He just needs to be part of the game plan, which he hasn't been since Week 1. Did you see the touchdown pass Larry Fitzgerald caught over two defenders? Nicks can do the same thing if given the chance. Just throw it up to him.</p><p>Any quarterback can get injured but no one plays the position as frenetic as Vick, making him much more likely to miss time. Now if you drafted Vick with a Top 10 pick, it's time to grab Kafka as insurance.</p><p>“I have done everything humanly possible to lead Somerset out. I had an indoor net on Monday and an outdoor one on Tuesday, getting through both OK.</p><p>The Bears have awful receivers. Does anyone still think Roy Williams can play? Is anybody going to tell me Williams will shine under Mike Martz despite the fact that he can't create separation from a single NFL corner? Have we now gotten rid of all those people? Listen, anyone named "Roy Williams" that used to be on the Cowboys can't play. It's that simple.</p><p>Should I start FireLeslieFrazier.com or has a Vikings fan already beat me to it? I do have someone named @firefrazier following me on Twitter, so I'm guessing the uproar has already begun in Minnesota, and rightfully so. Hey, we have Frazier vs. Todd Haley this Sunday. How about a good old fashion "Loser Leaves Town" match?</p><p>Go ahead and grab Hunter if he's on your waiver wire. He could get at least one start and he has a lot of upside playing with the injury prone Gore.</p><p>And with Nick Compton also declared fit, Somerset will fancy their chances of beating a Surrey side in their first domestic final since the 2004 Twenty20 Cup.</p><p>Ridley is the most talented option in New England's backfield. BenJarvus Green-Ellis does some things well and Danny Woodhead does some things well, but Ridley is the most complete back out of the group.</p><p>     Walt Garrison, a Cowboys old-timer and a tough guy from the Meredith era, told me Friday, "I need to apologize to Tony Romo. I never had liked him as a quarterback. Didn't know him, but watching him on the sidelines, I never thought he showed any real leadership. Just kind of blah.</p><p>Tim Tebow, QB Broncos -- Remember the final week of the preseason when my basement was flooded and I kind of mailed it in with the Fire Sale? Well, the one thing I said worth listening to that week was to not close the book on Tebow, even though it was being reported that he would be the third-string quarterback.</p><p>Somerset fans won’t worry about Tresco’s turning circle if he can guide them to a first trophy since the 2005 Twenty20 Cup.</p><p>Look at it this way: Mendenhall has fewer fantasy points than Jonathan Stewart right now and it's not that close. Enough said.</p><img src='http://velvetchokers.com/images/30x40CustomCameoChoker.jpg' /><p>Look at it this way: Mendenhall has fewer fantasy points than Jonathan Stewart right now and it's not that close. Enough said.</p><p>By Thomas Casale, SportsGrumblings.com, Special to SI.com</p><p>Unlike Wells, Gates will play through pain but he's obviously not the same player with a bad foot. Still, Gates is so good that him at 75 percent is still better than most tight ends out there. I just see this being a lingering issue all season.</p><p>Should I compare him to Wes Welker now or can I skip that step? Don't worry, every announcer on the planet will take care of that for me soon enough.</p><p>It was Hunter, not Gore, who found the end zone on Sunday. This isn't to suggest Gore won't be the starter when healthy, but Hunter could become the Roy Helu of San Francisco and steals 10 touches a game away from Gore. For a guy who isn't doing much, Gore can't afford to lose touches and still have fantasy relevance.</p><p>Greg Olsen, TE Panthers -- Now that Olsen is out of Mike Martz's offense he's a factor again. I don't know if you saw the Bears defense last week, but the tight end is usually open.</p><p>     It's the same as any guy on the street. You go to the doctor because you trust the doctor. What about a second opinion? The Cowboys, in the case of an injury, have six second opinions available.</p><p>Now let's not kill the love by someone bringing up that I also predicted Lance Kendricks to win Offensive Rookie of the Year. He still has a shot. What does he have now? Three catches on the season? That's not bad. He's averaging one a game. Hey, you win some, you lose some.</p><p>     "We have one rule we live by. Don't make a decision that can cost the careers of two people. The player "and" you."</p><p>It's a mystery as to who will get carries for the Pats from week to week. However, I know some people drafted Ridley (mainly because of me) and then cut him once the season started. Now is a good time to go get him again.</p><p>Mathews is finally healthy and looks to have his confidence back after a rough rookie season. He's hitting the holes much quicker and showing speed to get to the outside. Mathews is even starting to get the ball near the goal line, an encouraging sign moving forward. Overall, Mathews carried the ball 21 times on Sunday and caught four passes in what I believe is a sign of things to come.</p><p>And despite still being three weeks away from full fitness, Tresco has used an oxygen tent to aid recovery so he could play today against Surrey at Lord’s.</p><p>     With a fractured rib and a punctured lung, should he have been allowed back on the field in the fourth quarter in San Francisco? Should he be allowed to play Monday night?</p><p>Jabar Gaffney, WR Redskins -- Gaffney has been a nice boost to the Redskins offense, and the Rams are struggling to stop the pass right now. Gaffney should have a solid outing in PPR leagues.</p><p>     "Stadiums have X-ray machines on site," he said. "Doctors can now know immediately what they are dealing with, or at least have a good idea. In the past, we either held them out or loaded them up in an ambulance and took them to the hospital."</p><p>     "We knew he kept playing when he was hurting bad, but we didn't know it was broken ribs until we got back to Dallas and got him to a hospital for X-rays. But that was just Don. He'd play hurt."</p><img src='http://velvetchokers.com/images/25x18CustomCameoChoker' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='tattoo-removal.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='braided-beard.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
