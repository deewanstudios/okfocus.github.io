Launched in 2009, MTV's "A THIN LINE" campaign empowers America's youth 
      to identify, respond to, and stop the spread of digital abuse, which 
      includes all forms of digital bullying, dating abuse, and 
      discrimination. MTV is addressing these issues through thought-provoking 
      PSAs, integration into MTV's top-rated shows, innovative online and 
      mobile tools, and curricula. Additionally, as part of the campaign, MTV 
      will premiere an original TV movie, (DIS)CONNECTED, on Monday, 
      October 10 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. (DIS)CONNECTED tells the story of 
      four young people whose lives unexpectedly collide online and 
      illustrates how growing up digital can complicate life and love. The 
      film, which was first announced during the White House Conference on 
      Bullying Prevention and will air during National Bullying Prevention 
      Month, is inspired in part by the true, tragic tale of Abraham Biggs, a 
      19-year-old who battled bipolar disorder and ultimately webcast his 
      suicide after being egged on by a digital mob. For more information on

More than half of the respondents to an MTV/Associated Press study revealed they have been the targets of mean behavior or fake gossip on social-networking sites or text messages. The pervasiveness of digital abuse and cyberbullying in the study confirms a disturbing trend in which young people are using the Internet and wireless devices to harass each other, but also reveals that more are stepping up and saying something when they see abuse online.
