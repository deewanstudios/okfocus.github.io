				</p><p>Looking for coverage? Here's how to get your art events covered by Art City</p><p>“The arts touch the parts that science alone cannot reach, and vice versa,” said Ariane Koek, CERN's cultural specialist. “Collide@CERN gives CERN, artists and scientists the opportunity to engage in creative collisions that can occur when these two areas of human creativity and ingenuity come together.”</p><p>I've had this fantasy that the planet's most brilliant physicists and most talented artists are not only grappling with some of the same fundamental questions about the nature of the universe but that they might someday summit together, reaching their respective "theories of everything" only to scratch their heads and ask: "Hey, how did you get here?"
For this reason, I take a sort of perverse pleasure in watching the news come out of CERN, home to the largest particle collider in the world in Geneva, Switzerland. With CERN getting more and more data about things such as the existence (or non existence) of the Higgs boson, the supposed "god particle," we may be getting close to some real discoveries. It reminds me of the space race. Who will get there first?</p><p>

				</p><p>Newswise — Geneva, 2 September 2011. A new kind of collision will soon be taking place at the CERN1’s Geneva laboratory. The Collide@CERN artists’ residency programme means that, as well as colliding particles, CERN will be bringing scientific and artistic creativity into contact. The programme was announced today at the Ars Electronica festival in Linz, Austria.</p><p>Art and architecture critic Mary Louise Schumacher explores Milwaukee's creative endeavors</p><img src='http://static.zooomr.com/images/7691047_1ea6ae068f_o.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='true-life-quotes.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='tween-perfumes.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
