BIGGEST ADVANTAGES Wisconsin hosts the Cornhuskers in Nebraska’s first Big Ten game, something that is being greeted with fervor by Nebraska’s passionate fan base. Wisconsin derailed Ohio State’s national title dreams last year in Madison, which has evolved into one of college football’s most difficult places to play. Wisconsin has not lost a fumble through four games, and Wilson (11 touchdowns, 1 interception) is ranked second nationally in passing efficiency.        </p><p>BabaOReally: I am looking forward to seeing Illinois and Northwestern battle it out for the title of Chicago's B1G team. The big key to this game is obviously the health of Persa. It will be interesting to see how close he is to 100%. Will he be PERSASTRONG or PERSARUSTY? I think Illinois will win this one and the Northwestern optimists and their 10-2 predictions will start to realize that maybe they are not going to make that big of a leap this year.</p><p>  Remember </p><p>

BIGGEST MOMENT The Badgers have four road games remaining, three of which will be difficult. Wisconsin must play at Michigan State, at Ohio State and at Illinois. While Ohio State has been inconsistent, the Buckeyes will have the suspended tailback Dan Herron, receiver DeVier Posey and offensive lineman Mike Adams back. Those are Ohio State’s best players at each position, which will fortify the Buckeyes’ offense.        </p><p>Here’s your background info via the always resourceful Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jucy_Lucy</p><p>Starting at:   $56.99  from 5 stores </p><p> Graham Filler

</p><p>Hilary Lee: I'm saying the Northwestern-Illinois game, though not just because I'm a Wildcat fan. This game will answer questions about these teams that should tell us what trajectory the rest of their seasons are likely to go in:</p><p>
Boise State will certainly remain in the national title hunt, but it will need a season of chaos to slide into the title game. The addition of Pac-12 and Big Ten title games will be a huge boon to the Broncos, who need teams to keep losing. Boise State will probably face only one ranked team, No. 20 Texas Christian, the rest of the season.        </p><p>Considering the radical designs of many of Nike's college football uniforms, people are anxious to see how the new duds will looks.</p><p>The posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal attacks is prohibited.

Game after game, Toon has showed up to play, and it looks like he might actually surpass his 2009 numbers. I keep waiting for him to trip up, but he just gets better, and having a solid receiver like that makes Wilson's arm that much more terrifying.</p><p>Is The Economy Getting Better Or Worse?

</p><p>Ted Glover: Well, let's look at those bad losses. North Texas, North Dakota State, New Mexico State, and Rice were from the three worst teams in the conference. I don't see any of those teams going to a bowl game, so as far as the rest of the conference is concerned, meh. Army isn't a bad team, and I think if Dan Persa had played they win. At the top, I think Wisconsin and Nebraska can be dominant teams, and although everyone in between those two and the bottom three are flawed, they're still good. Adding Nebraska will put B1G teams against more evenly mtached opponents as opposed to having to play our 4th place team against whoever's second or third place team. I think we'll be all right.</p><img src='http://www.prodirectsoccer.com/siteimages/pages/base-layers/football-clothing.jpg' /><p>Ted Glover: Well, let's look at those bad losses.
