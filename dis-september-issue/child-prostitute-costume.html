Some may be clueless may need a bitter reality check. Others may think that the only way to be accepted in this world is to be perfectly presentable to everyone and to always wear a ton of make-up and hairspray. </p><p>The point is that looks aren’t going to get you accepted into college or give you the fundamental knowledge that is needed to succeed in life. </p><p>So much for age-appropriate attire!</p><p>Her mother should be slapped in the face by everyone in the world!

Worse than the outfits, etc, are the attitudes these kids are allowed to have.  They are royal brats in a lot of cases, with the tiny tots ordering their parents around, throwing fits to get what they want, and back-talking.  They are greeted with giggles and "she is just so darn cute" instead of good parenting consisting of teaching them how to behave.  It's disgusting.</p><p>would she wear that? If not why then would you get your child to? </p><p>
