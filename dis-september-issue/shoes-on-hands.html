According to Nikolai Podguzov, head of fixed income strategy at VTB Capital, probably a bit of rouble volatility.</p><p>The Morrisville group heard about the project through youth leader
Cheryl Hinkle, who received an e-mail forward from Summers about a
Methodist church in Springfield that is also serving as a
collection site.</p><p>
					
					</p><p>“The ministry of finance’s politics are continuing and will continue as they were, and oriented at guaranteeing macroeconomic stability and reducing the risks to the budget. We must not increase expenses without finding corresponding sources of revenue.”</p><p>The leader of the struggling Chicago Bears’ offense said it’s about correcting mistakes being made, not looking for ways to tinker what’s being done in Mike Martz’s scheme.</p><p>The group has collected about 400 pounds of shoes so far, and their
intermediate goal is 500. The Sole Food project’s goal is 20,000
pounds. Summers commends the students for their willingness to be
generous givers and love the people of the Springfield area and
people all over the world.</p><p>“Don’t judge a man until you’ve walked a mile in his shoes” is
an old adage, but “generous,” “loving” and “eternal impact” will be
the judgment of some local kids written on the “soles” of children
and adults all over the world.</p><p>dallas214mom said on September 28, 2011 at 2:20 PM</p><p>"I'll put (my cane) out in front of me and I'm able to feel any cracks in the sidewalk with it," said Blake Lindsay, a spokesperson at Dallas Lighthouse for the Blind.</p><p>“This is a service project that’s going to grow and grow and grow,”
said MUMC Pastor Larry Summers. “Where it goes, no one
knows.”</p><p>© 2009-2011 WFAA-TV, Inc., a subsidiary of Belo Corp. All Rights Reserved.</p><p>“What we can see is the power of one,” Summers said. “If you’re an
[old] one or a young one, you can make a difference. It all started
with one multi-colored pair of tennis shoes. By itself, that pair
doesn’t count for a lot. But put a bunch of pairs together and it’s
a powerful message that can transform the world. It’s not a crazy
thing. It’s a God thing.”</p><p>What a great concept.  I'm sure it can be refined down to where it is barely noticable.  I commend this class for taking on this project.</p><p>© The Financial Times Ltd 2011 FT and 'Financial Times' are trademarks of The Financial Times Ltd. </p><p>And they just might do it.</p><img src='http://www.diandolls.com/diandolls%20images/grandpa%20set.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='colorful-ties.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='broken-heel.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
