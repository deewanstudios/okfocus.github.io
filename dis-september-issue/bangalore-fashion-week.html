Once they got lodged in people's hearts as Saraswathi, they became Swarovski on the tongue. “We've learnt how to take our product forward,” says Sharma, who was in Chennai recently for a company do — a fashion show of Swarovski-embellished saris, other apparel and jewellery by designers and destination stores in Chennai and Bangalore, where some master craftsmen of Kanjeevaram saris were also honoured. Elements is Swarovski's brand of crystal components that can be used to create and decorate, among other things, apparel, accessories, jewellery, interiors and lighting. The Austria-based €2.66-billion Swarovski also sells crystal figurines and accessories in India.</p><p>CoutureNow this one has a whole host of options to pick from. On the more traditional side of things there’s Deepam Silks and Prerna Garg’s Drama Queen line. While the latter would showcase lehengas, salwar suits, tunics and saris, Deepam will showcase The Dream Wedding Collection, consisting both ethnic and contemporary bridal wear. From georgettes to jamevars, Swarovski embellishments to zardozi embroidery — there’s something for every bride. Then there’s Pragati Mathur’s customised, hand woven, hue dyed saris too.</p><p>The next frontier, though, is fashion jewellery and bridal wear, says Sharma. He advances several arguments in favour of fashion jewellery: Heavy jewellery remains mostly in the bank locker; you can't wear it often; and party-hoppers, especially women, can sport new looks by changing just their jewellery (“men at least can change inside the car”) and not be mocked by the fashion police for wearing the same clothes. And, of course, it doesn't burn a hole in the pocket, prices range from Rs 2,000 to Rs 30,000.</p><p>Vaseline - Dressing Room</p><p>
