<img src='http://dancingczars.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dystopia-skyline-moebuis.jpg'><p>'Terra Nova' recap: Meet Jim Shannon</p><p>"Terra Nova" is also tinged with shades of "Lost," and not just because of the jungle. We meet the Sixers, renegade humans who control the quarry and live outside of the village's boundaries. Unlike the others, the Sixers seem to believe in some mysterious conspiracy involving unintelligible scribbles on rocks and speculation about what Terra Nova was really founded for. </p><p>The past is a lush paradise with solar panels, wind turbines, exotic fruits and little cottages that let in the sunlight (a novelty for our futuristic friends). It's a spectacular backdrop (filmed in Australia) of snaking vines, immense trees, and strange animals. Commander Nathaniel Taylor (Stephen Lang, seemingly reprising a variation on his "Avatar" character) is the leader of this little camp, and according to him, the first man ever to have arrived in Terra Nova.</p><p>Loyola PhoenixPhone number: 773-508-7110E-mail: phoenix@luc.eduAddress: 6525 N.

    </p><p>Am I the only one who’s surrounded herself with enough science
fiction to be creeped out by this? These “QR codes” could just be
Big Brother’s scheme for keeping an oogly eye on us. Might these
shifty barcodes providing “info” outside U.S. Army recruiting
centers be used to follow potential soldiers? Are QR codes on cars
fuel economy labels, or are they really tracking devices for common
civilians who ride over to the local Piggly Wiggly or Dairy Queen
at a curious hour in the night? Yes, frightened citizens, this
deserves a “dun dun dun…”</p><p>I jest, all you inked brethren. In fact, babies in the future
are all going to have Scanz tattoos. We’ll be scanned as
prospective employees during interviews, and as possible tenants.
Strangers will scan us and stalk us. And the future will totally
suck. I get that linking social networks and internet sites might
be appealing or convenient to some, but making it readily available
on your wrist? Weird. We’ll go around scanning each other, saying,
“No, no, he won’t do, he likes Nickelback” (okay, I guess that
one’s fair). I suppose I’m just going to have to get used to being
judged just because I’d rather see what’s up on Jersey Shore than watch the news.</p><p>To the extent that violence is displayed, it is characterized by a uniform choreography that amplifies the systematic planning and intent behind it. As the prisoners march out in humiliation, the deathly precision of their movements against a backdrop of ominous thunder and flashing lights accentuates a sense of a twisted artistry. The set itself contributes to the bleak atmosphere by using continually changing lighting to resemble a turbulent landscape of dark rolling clouds. Untamed, primal nature serves as a metonym for the darkness that has engulfed society. The melodramatic staging facilitates the subtle, deft manner in which the script and actors confront the controversial subject of mass murder.</p><p>What in glob’s name is a “Scanz” bracelet? Well, each bracelet,
with its QR code, connects its owner to a Scanzsite where the owner
uploads his or her contact info, photos, videos, likes and dislikes
and links to all manner of social media. Now, if two “Scanz” owners
are close to one another in a room, they can scan each other, watch
videos of each other, find out where they grew up and what they
looked like in high school via prehistoric Facebook photos. The
first problem we need to talk about is the name. Anything spelled
with a “z” at the end should be beaten and tossed into the East
River. There are some other things wrong with this stupid flipping
piece of rubber. In the words of dear grandpas everywhere, I ask
Scanz-wearers: “What’s the matter, you?” We really don’t have time
in our miserable days to ask each other about our interests?</p><img src='http://mikeduran.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/dystopia-jpg-w300h217.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='korean-towel-hat.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='lucy-orta.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
