I own the South Beach fragrance from the Paris Hilton Passport Collection, which has three scents (the other two are Tokyo and Paris). Each bottle is a collector's item if you are into anime. As can be gleaned from the names of the perfumes, the scents were inspired by Paris' favorite cities (do we see a Manila fragrance very soon?). The description for South Beach is "All about playful days and magical nights; fresh and seductive, this fragrance teases with voluptuous notes of sweet, juicy Nectarine. Cool and sheer, luminous Lotus Flower notes awaken the senses while a bright, sunny splash of White Freesia invigorates the heart of South Beach. The sun's energy radiates from the bright, golden Marigold flower at the heart, but it's the summery note of Jasmine Sambac and the floral-fruity essence of Osmanthus that offer the promise of warmth no matter what the season. As the sun goes down and the fragrance lingers, the essence of modern sensuality is bared: Blonde Woods and Australian Sandalwood connect with Captive Musk."South Beach is something that a diehard Paris Hilton will love as I can imagine that this is what the reality show star smelled like when she was a tween—sweet and fruity.</p><p>Opinionmore</p><p>Album of the Week: Dan Mangan, Oh Fortune</p><p>First Drive: 2012 Ford Mustang GT Convertible</p><p>On the Homestead:  More rubber boots given the boot</p><p>But, is it as bad as Justin Bieber commercial for his scent Someday?

Thirteen years after The Last Days of Disco, Whit Stillman is still obsessed with preppies’ peccadilloes — and, apparently, he still loves to boogie. His zippy new film, more arch than St. Louis’s Gateway to the West, is set in a cartoonish college campus dominated by a Greek system that for some reason uses Roman letters. 
Greta Gerwig plays Violet, the ringleader of a crew of do-gooder mean girls who run a suicide-watch center that helps the depressed through the healing power of tap and honky-tonk line dancing. She adopts a gawky sophomore transfer, Lily (played by former America’s Top Model contestant Analeigh Tipton, who has become a go-to gawky teen), and shares with her the secrets to her success: perfume, cute clothes, and charity work (including the act of dating dumb boys in order to improve their lives). “I love clichés and hackneyed phrases,” says Violet, who goes on to mouth Stillman-arch epigrams like: “I don’t think cool people are much less human. Just enough to be cool.” </p><p>Posted Toronto</p><p>

  Justin Bieber's Someday, which looks like Marc Jacobs' Lola, is a "fruity gourmand." The pop star will donate a portion of the scent’s profits to two of his favorite charities, Pencils of Promise and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Someday,earned $3 million in receipts in its first three weeks on sale at Macy’s Herald Square, according to the New York Daily News. Someday will launch early next year in the Philippines.</p><p>
