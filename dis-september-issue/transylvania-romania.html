						    </p><p>This was probably the only environment in which the unique accident of history that engendered the Sabbatarian movement could have occurred. Its founder is generally thought to be Andras Eossy, an educated nobleman and landowner from the Szekely nation, an ancient people whose origins are the subject of dispute. First testimonies of their settlement in Transylvania exist only from the beginning of the 10th century, though recent DNA-based studies suggest they may be the forebears of the Hungarian nation. Like many aristocrats from the Szekely people, Andras Eossy converted to the Unitarian Church. This was in 1567, in the wake of the conversion of the former king of Hungary, John II Sigismund Zapolya. Underlying the Unitarian creed is the belief in the unity of God.
						    </p><p>According to Toronyi, one of the books in the archive's small collection is considered the earliest of all, probably dating from the end of the 16th century. Restoration has saved it from disintegration. The letters are simple and clean, and there are no illustrations or decorations. Toronyi says this may be the handwriting of Pechi himself. The later books show a greater investment in calligraphy. The titles are stylized under Gothic influence and the first letters of the paragraphs are decorated with flowers and floral motifs. Some of the books contain quotations in Hebrew. The style of the letters resembles the script used in medieval Torah scrolls in Germany.The Sabbatarians' prayer books follow the Sephardic formulation. According to various analyses, Pechi used a prayer book from a Jewish community in Turkey for the translation. In his Hungarian version, the order of the blessings and the words sometimes differs from the original. There are also minor differences in the texts of the prayers. But the general message and the intention are always identical: God is one. And he is the God of the Jews.

Even eight street signs in Palmerston North took on a change - major thoroughfare Fitzherbert Avenue was given a temporary posting as "Fitzylvania Street"; a cheeky play on the Romanian region Transylvania.</p><p>Margot Ishtavenfi turned 80 this summer. She is lucid, articulate and brimming with energy and joie de vivre. She and her husband live in a small house with a red-tile roof opposite the Catholic church in the Transylvanian village of Criseni. In the backyard, which is enclosed by a faded wooden fence, they cultivate a small vegetable patch and raise a few chickens. At the end of spring, when night falls and the temperature plummets to close to freezing, they heat the house with a wood stove. They do not have a television set. The Internet and cellular phones have not yet reached the village, which is connected to the main highway only by a bad road of 20 kilometers - a distance measured in local terms as "an hour and a half's ride in a horse-drawn cart."
						    </p><p>At the last minute, Istvan was able to get a small number of Jews and Sabbatarians taken off the train. One of them was Andre Rozenczi. "The priest actually clashed with the gendarmes and the German SS soldiers," he recalls. "When they refused to allow us to leave the train station, he stood opposite them, puffed out his chest and said, 'They are just as good Christians as I am. I would rather you shoot me and do not take them.'"
						    </p><p>Peri researched the history of Hungarian Jewry and devoted one of his dozens of books to the Sabbatarian community in Transylvania. He knew the community from his childhood in the town of Tirgu Mures and recalled meeting some of its members in the ghetto. 
						    </p><p>Eossy disseminated the principles of the new faith he had adopted among his courtiers. They were soon joined by dozens of peasants who farmed his lands. The movement's major growth occurred in the period of his successor, Simon Pechi, who was his adopted son and close adviser. Pechi is described in Hungarian history books as a statesman, poet and caustic thinker who was fluent in 12 languages. As a young man, he was sent by his patron on long journeys to the Middle East and North Africa in search of ancient holy manuscripts. He visited Jerusalem, Constantinople and Cairo and met members of Jewish communities. After returning to Transylvania, he translated the movement's first prayer books from Hebrew to Hungarian and distributed them via envoys to dozens of congregations and villages.
						    </p><p>Most studies place the total number of believers at between a few hundred and a few thousand. The largest community emerged in Bozodujfalu, a village that lay in an isolated green valley in the heart of a region known as Szekely Land. In 1867, about a quarter of the village's 700 inhabitants declared that they belonged to the Sabbatarian sect. Hungarian newspapers of the time reported that the community's members celebrated for three days the religious freedom they had been granted after centuries of persecution. They took a holiday from work and marched in a procession to the nearby village, Sangeorgiu de Padure, where they circled around the synagogue of the Orthodox congregation with song and prayer.
						    </p><p>SIBIU, Romania (AP) — Times are so hard in Romania that people joke they cannot afford to die. Yet in the mountains of Transylvania, carpenters are churning out cut-price coffins in a bid to beat the rising costs of death.</p><p>"So, gradually, only Shabbat-keepers were left in the ghetto, or those whose religion was in doubt," she continues. "One day, the gendarmes sent us to clean the place. After we were done they put us on vehicles and on horse-drawn carts and took us to a large building in Tirgu Mures, which had been the Jews' synagogue. By now nothing was left of the things we had with us in the ghetto, and that night we slept on the floor. From there we were taken in the morning to the train station."
						    </p><p>An example of this was noted in September 1902, in an article published in the Jerusalem  newspaper Havatzelet. According to the article, a soldier from the Sabbatarian sect refused to bear arms on Shabbat, "because in the sect's opinion there is no greater Sabbath desecration than this." The article adds that the soldier insisted "courageously" in clinging to his faith, "and all the warnings of the army's officials and all the torments were to no avail." In the meantime, the "local Jews are waiting eagerly" to see what happens; they want very much to know "whether the army can also force Christians to violate their religion, or only Jews."

Afterward, from the morning hours, family after family from the community started to arrive in our yard. All told, about 50 people arrived. They carried the few things they had managed to take from the house. The gendarmes housed them in the barn next to the stable and did not let us communicate with them in any way. My grandmother - my father's mother - was also housed in the barn. The family implored the gendarmes, but to no avail. They would not allow her to enter the house."

"They spent most of the time reading Psalms; they knew the Hebrew letters better than I did. One Friday afternoon I did not see one of the older women in her usual place in front of the tent. A young woman was standing there, polishing her husband's shoes before Shabbat. I asked her where the older woman was and she told me she was inside the tent. I went inside and found her sitting on an embroidered cushion, crying. I asked her why she was crying so bitterly and she replied that the candles had run out and there was nothing with which to consecrate Shabbat. I went to people I knew and managed to collect a few candles, which I took to the tent. She thanked me with tears of joy. Even when I was some way from the tent I could still hear her words of gratitude."

"The Hungarian government is having difficulty in finding a solution to the legal status of the 1,200 non-Jewish Shabbat-keepers who live in Transylvania," the report said. "The members of this sect are of Aryan origin but observe Shabbat and the Jewish dietary laws. As a result, the prohibition on kosher slaughter affects them, too. They are neither Jews nor Christians, and not even the Nuremberg Laws contain any measures for solving this problem."

"It grieves me to see what is left," she says, placing the palm of one hand on her chest. The priest has a hard time deciding whether she is saying that this situation "wrings" or "wrenches" her heart. Finally he tries to illustrate with his hands; in pantomime, the two gestures are indistinguishable. In 1989, the authorities flooded the valley in which the village of Bozodujfalu is located, by direct order of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu.

						    </p><p>The archive is located in a side wing of Budapest's Great Synagogue, not far from the house in which Theodor Herzl was born. There is also a souvenir shop on the premises. Even though the site has become one of the city's most popular tourist attractions in the past few years, its valuable archive looks outdated. It has not yet undergone computer scanning or digitization, and the same goes for the database of contents. All this might hamper the search, but when the prayer books are at last found, they can be touched, their worn covers caressed and their pages, written more than 400 years ago, be riffled through.
						    </p><p>"I remember transports leaving from the ghetto twice. The ghetto started to empty out of Jews. The more time that passed, the more room there was in the factory building, and a few people who were living in the courtyard were moved inside. I remember that the Stein family, who were our neighbors in Bozodujfalu, were taken in the second transport. There was another woman there from the village. She was pregnant and her daughter was there, too. In the end, they were sent to Auschwitz. I also remember that the Pirushko family, who were Shabbat-keepers and our neighbors, were sent to Auschwitz in the same transport. The wife was named Luba, her husband was Jewish and they had two children. They were all sent and no one came back.

Throughout the country, Jews were ordered to enter ghettos and wear a yellow patch on their outer clothing. The order also applied to the converts in Bozodujfalu. Seeking to appeal the edict, Lajus Rozenczi showed the Gestapo officers and the Hungarian police the letter of protection he had received just a few years earlier. For a few weeks, the group remained in the village and demonstratively appeared in public without the patch. But the ancient legal hairsplitting was of no interest to Fernec Koreh, the Hungarian gendarmerie officer who was appointed to deal with the issue. Before the German conquest, Koreh had published vicious anti-Semitic articles in the local press, and now, after consulting with Sturmbannfuhrer Schroder - the SS officer in charge of the region - he gathered forces from the local gendarmerie and raided the village.

Around noon, two gendarmes arrived and told us to leave the house. Outside we saw Joshka and Ester Kovacs, who also belonged to the Shabbat-keepers community. They walked ahead of us, and in front of them there was another family. We walked in a convoy. A few Christian residents of the village tried to encourage us and said how sorry they were that we were going. The gendarmes shut them up and told them to close themselves in their houses. They said they would shoot anyone who dared talk to us or they would take them with us. They had no choice - they were silent.
						    </p><p>The only photographs that perpetuate the community are in the Jewish Archive in Budapest. The identity of the photographer is unknown, but from the information he noted on the backs of the pictures, it can be inferred that he visited Bozodujfalu at the beginning of the 1930s.

</p><p>There is no mention of the Bozodujfalu community in Beit Hatfutsot − the Museum of the Jewish People − in Tel Aviv, or in the Safed-based museum devoted to the heritage of Hungarian-speaking Jewry. Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, has no information or testimonies about the community’s fate in the Holocaust, apart from a few lines in its book devoted to the Jewish communities of Romania. It states that some of them did not want to accept the exemption certificates that were obtained for them by the community’s leaders and that they were sent to Auschwitz together with the rest of the Jews. Most of the works of history and research that mention the Sabbatarians maintain that no more than 100 of them perished. However, the historian Yitzhak Peri said that the number was far higher.

						    </p><p>According to Peri, several thousand members of the community were murdered in the Holocaust: “I found a reference to 1,511 of these Jews in an SS cable sent by Eichmann’s staff to Himmler. Another German document states that there were 17,500 Jews in the Tirgu Mures ghetto. I checked the lists. Only about 12,000 were really [Jews]. In my estimate, about 5,000 Sabbatarians and maybe more were murdered in the Holocaust.”
