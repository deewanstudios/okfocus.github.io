Quite often, actors and actresses resort to cosmetic procedures to enhance and/or maintain their look. Many times the procedures go unnoticed, which is exactly how it's supposed to work,” Alec Shankman, former talent agent and founder of the online casting agency GotCast.com. “However, there are some young stars like Heidi Montag who push it to the limit. We see otherwise naturally beautiful girls who became borderline unrecognizable in an effort to permanently 'photo-shop' themselves. This makes them look non-human and sends a terrible message to young girls around the country.”</p><p>After Leis' speech at the conference, the two chatted.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can no longer dress up as Anna Rexia, the sexy body dysmorphia sufferer. </p><p>It was, paradoxically, cut for quite the busty Halloween goer, which sort of makes no sense (last we check, eating disorder victims aren't the curviest). </p><p>A little empathy goes a long way people. Just because you can't understand something doesn't make it invalid to those who are experiencing it. As with most "mental" issues (like clinical depression), if you've never experienced it you'll never know what it's like. I feel for these people who struggle with their gender and identity. It's something most people just take for granted. Biology and genetics are still mostly a mystery and while people think we know everything about it today, they thought the same way 100 years ago. I'm sure that 100 years from now people will look back on our time and think how ignorant we were.</p><p>That's blackmail of the NHS! Sorry, but they should have 'patched' him up and let him pay for his own surgery!
- Enough!, England, 27/9/2011 13:51+++++++Don't forget to charge the going rate for his self-enforced surgery.- donny bob, doncaster, england, 27/9/2011 14:20++++++Money well spent!! Why should we waste NHS budgets on cancer patients and old folk when it can be used for gender realignment.- Swanseajock, Swansea, 27/9/2011 14:52++++++Gender dysphoria is an internationally accepted medical condition caused during foetal development. Instead of complaining about the miniscule effects transsexuals have on the NHS budget, try complaining about the billions wasted on those who are deliberately damaging their own health eg smokers, drug addicts, the obese, alcoholics and binge drinkers. These selfish people cost the NHS Billions, whereas transsexuals would barely cost one or two million per annum. Which they have paid for in paying their taxes.

"Unbeknownst to me, he was sitting in the audience listening to my lecture on female-to-male top and bottom surgery, female-to-male gender reassignment surgery. He had some people with him who were taping the entire lecture. After my talk, I met Chaz, who had some questions about some of the things that I spoke about."</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Weekdays 1p et</p><img src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Z2lRlutn-WU/SL89VasJEkI/AAAAAAAAAEU/Ab9lAbintx0/S1600-R/Dysmorphia.jpg' /><p>Weekdays 1p et</p><p>
