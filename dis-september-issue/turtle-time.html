Less than 10% of the approximately 2,400 animal exhibitors licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture are accredited. During the accreditation process, Turtle Back Zoo underwent a thorough review to ensure it has and will continue to meet ever-rising standards, which include animal care, veterinary programs, conservation, education, and safety. AZA requires zoos and aquariums to successfully complete this rigorous accreditation process every five years in order to be members of the Association.

This month, the Zoo opens "Treetop Adventure Course," an aerial obstacle course including elements such as zip lines, rope bridges and other sky-high attractions. Next month, the Big Cats Exhibit will make its debut.
