		  Wish that Davey Buoy ,,,er person would go join up ... his mouth at least. Afghanistan ain't far enough away.
That is no lady. It's a felon. Convicted too.- Jonny Brown, Anglesea, 16/09/2011 20:18Report abuse

		  At least she has the guts to go there, that's more than most of the idiots writing have.- peter, London, 16/09/2011 20:27Report abuse

		  Who is this person ? Never, ever heard of anyone by that name. By what measure, means or merit does this inolve "celebrity" ? Please enlighten me.- Bobby Ferguson, NW 3, 16/09/2011 14:27Report abuse

		  There MUST be a better way of cheering up the troops than having this stupid moronic tart turn up...just what they need!!!- Steve Hamilton, Totnes, Devon, 17/09/2011 12:26Report abuse
		  </p><p>At sunset there was a commemoration of the Battle of Britain by a 400-strong RAF contingent. Winston Churchill's words of 71 years ago about the "few" and the "finest hour" were read as the sun sank across the desert. A lone Chinook helicopter flew low.</p><p>"Churchill's words are as relevant now as then," Squadron Leader the Rev Geoff Withers declared. "They are as meaningful for us in Afghanistan today as they were to wartime Britain."</p><p>

		  This is really quite desperate. Her PR team must be working overtime.- David, London, UK, 16/09/2011 12:21Report abuse

		  Didn't the Lt General mean de-brief her?!- Dickie D, Surrey England, 16/09/2011 18:24Report abuse
		  </p><p>"I am a real fan - and I would have enjoyed briefing her." His assistant Lt Colonel Charlie Collins found he and Cole had been given rooms next to each other. Wistfully, he wondered what would have happened had been a muddle with the room labels and keys.</p><p>

		    </p><p>Cole, 27, spent much of her time with the dogs and their handlers of the bomb disposal unit, who have one of the most dangerous jobs of all in Afghanistan. "She asked really thoughtful questions," said Lt Purbrick, confessing himself a real "Cheryl fan".</p><p>
		  Hey Kirsty. Got a great suggestion. Ask this woman to go back where she belongs. With the rest of you in Nevernever land. This is all a load of rubbish and should not be taking up space when really meaningful stories are not given newspace.
How did she get out of jail, anyway ?- Joe Brown, Poole, Dorset, 18/09/2011 18:55Report abuse
		  </p><p>Cole, veteran of The X Factor and other campaigns, went down a storm with the troops. "She was genuine, and very well-informed," said Lt Colonel Tim Purbrick, who is spokesman for Task Force Helmand but willingly redeployed to Cole media escort duties.</p><p>
		  See how long she stays around once the cameras and their initial interest fades.
Clearly nobody told her PR team the military services are facing cuts, not Cowell type financial helplines.
Another problem is that camel saddles are rather high and I believe nice as she is, Cheryl may also find it difficult making camels understand Geordie English.
So she may well find herself delivered back to LA across the Gobi desert, then the Atlantic, cooked to a frazzle, with no eye liner in sight.
Take care out there Cheryl.- Concerned Observer, Harrow, 17/09/2011 11:52Report abuse
