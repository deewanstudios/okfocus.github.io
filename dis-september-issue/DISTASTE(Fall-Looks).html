Leeds, promoted in 1964 under Don Revie and having developed a reputation for violent and underhand tactics, instantly proved themselves in the top-flight, and they had lost just two of their previous 29 games in all competitions when they met Matt Busby's Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough. What transpired was a game so fiery that it sparked a burning hatred that has lasted almost half a century.

The visitors' team bus was greeted by hundreds of furious home fans, who surrounded the vehicle and chanted 'Judas', and his every touch throughout the game was met by ferocious boos. Cantona had an uncharacteristically quiet night on the pitch - though he did have a couple of efforts on goal - and a soft booking on the half-hour was his most significant contribution.

</p><p>
Leeds boss David O'Leary then hit back at Ferguson: "Maybe it's age. Maybe the great man's memory is going at 59 - he did say Barthez should have been sent off on Saturday ... I don't know, maybe he has had a bad weekend."

The Guardian labelled the match "a sordid shambles that would have been flattered by being played on an ashpit" and added: "Everyone knew it would be more than manly - for there are players on both sides who do not like to give way in a physical challenge - but few were pessimistic enough to expect that it would so often come so close to open violence."

The Daily Mirror's Frank McGhee expressed similar outrage: "This was X-certificate stuff, ferocious soccer that crawled from underneath a flat stone to spread the ugly diseases of provocation, retaliation and revenge."

Sir Alex Ferguson had warned his players that, coming off the back of a shock defeat to Middlesbrough and with Arsenal and Liverpool holding the advantage in the title race, they would have to win each of their remaining six games to take the title.

Leeds midfielder Johnny Giles said ahead of the game: "Manchester United are now in the same situation as a child who has been given a bar of chocolate and then had it taken away before it can be eaten. I'm convinced that United will be much more dangerous after their slump than if they had been in the middle of a good run."

Even so, he was in the headlines for weeks after the game: he spat at the Leeds supporters as he made his way towards the dressing room and subsequently received an FA fine of £1,000, mitigated on the grounds of provocation. "I knew I was going to get a hot reception tonight," Cantona said after the match. "If I was a Leeds fan, I would have reacted the same way."

Luke Chadwick and Mark Viduka scored the goals in a 1-1 draw, but a Wes Brown own goal had been chalked off at the death for an offside. However, it was another decision from the officials that prompted a bitter war of words in the aftermath. At the end of the first half, goalkeeper Fabien Barthez came to claim a cross and, as the ball was cleared, directed his studs into Ian Harte in a petulant off-the-ball challenge.

It was not until April 2001 that Keane took his revenge, by which time Haaland had moved on to Manchester City. "I'd waited long enough," he wrote in his autobiography. "I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c***. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries. Even in the dressing room afterwards, I had no remorse. My attitude was, f*** him. What goes around, comes around. He got his just rewards."
