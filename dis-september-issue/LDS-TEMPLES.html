Randall, please read Mike’s comments. The purpose of my article was to question what the faithful Mormon would-be converts are doing, not to “attack” Judaism. In fact, I tried to make the point that no one who truly respects Judaism would sanction this kind of “conversion.” As for building bridges, this can only be done in a spirit of truth. Thank you all for your readership. Shabbat shalom.
</p><p>PHILADELPHIA, PA. -- Intersecting both American and 
important church history, LDS church leaders broke ground 
for a temple Saturday in downtown Philadelphia, PA. 
</p><p>I have always thought of you to be the bridge between Mormonism and Judaism. I firmly belive the spiritual leaders in Israel, although not having the same Priesthood as LDS members, are driven by the Light of Christ to organize and lead that faith. I hope you will continue to focus on areas where we have common beliefs and understandings as I learn much more from those articles. I felt your article today did more to divide the two faiths than all of the work you have written in a while.  </p><p>Advertisement</p><p>If that didn’t make it clear, those who think they can have their cake, and eat it too, ought to carefully re-read the Book of Mormon.

 </p><p>I have an LDS acquaintance who informed me of a desire to do just what you describe. She wanted to convert to Judaism but not renounce her current beliefs. I told her in no uncertain terms that no legitimate rabbi would accede to such a request. It never even occurred to me that someone might go about conversion through total deception of the beit din.

The temple - diagonally across the street from the 
prominent landmark, Logan Square - will serve the 
Pennsylvania, Delaware and some New Jersey and Maryland 
areas. About 30,000 church members across eight stakes 
will be within its boundaries in those areas, as the 
church has divided it.

  </p><p>And DeBoer said he felt eager for the blessings of having the temple so close by to return to local residents, especially young people.</p><p>"As you look ahead, you recognize that it will open up a whole new era for the Ogden area," he said. "The church has done a good job in providing development around it. It will bring solace to the community."</p><p> Notify me of follow-up comments?</p><img src='http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/saltlake/images/salt-lake-mormon-temple.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='sarah-palin-alaska.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='stadium-at-night.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
