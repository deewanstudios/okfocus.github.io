Morial Convention Center. And for Jake Shields, it will be an emotional return to the octagon.</p><p>Public Company Sign-Up</p><p>Shields said there was never any doubt about him moving forward, but it wasn't easy to do.</p><p>Until tomorrow (at least) the scramble for cash remains the order of the day...</p><p>Share markets also did the "twist" (of pain) as investors threw what now appears to be a global-in-scope tantrum and sold everything including babies and bottles of bath water. The Hang Seng Index lost 4.85% while the Shanghai Index fell by more than 2.5% and so did the Nikkei, the Kospi and the Aussie ASX. European stocks fared even worse in the wake of the Fed's bond-swap dance. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 3.9% while France's CAC lost nearly 5% and the Dax in Germany caved by 4%. The FTSE also played footsie with the floor leading to the exit doors and received a 4.5% haircut this morning.</p><p>Get Stock Alerts</p><p>Tonight's fights are the first UFC events in New Orleans since UFC 27 on Sept. 22, 2000. Doors open at 3 p.m., and the first match is scheduled to start at 4. </p><p>Koch (12-1) defeated Raphael Assuncao with a first-round TKO on strikes.

Platinum and palladium also trimmed former safe-haven premia from their value equations and slid $46 and $33 respectively, revealing themselves to be more industrial than insurance metals. The former was quoted at $1,713 and the latter dropped to $660 the ounce, going beyond lows at $695 recorded many months ago. Rhodium remained static with a bid of $1,800.00 per troy ounce. Dow futures augured a possible 250+ point drop in value for the day ahead. US initial jobless claims came in below expectations at 423,000 last week but the four-week average is still running at its highest level in sixty days' time.</p><p>Thus, Thursday's opening bell witnessed a sea of red on the New York commodities' exchanges floors. Gold dropped $43 to the $1,737.50 spot bid level prompting a re-evaluation (and then some) of its near-term prospects despite the louder-than-loud "back up the truck, honey!" calls coming from the permabull gold bug forums. The yellow metal could now be targeting the $1,700 pivot zone-one that must hold lest we head to $1,660 and then towards the high $1,400s on the charts. Ditto for silver-it must try to remain above $37.80 or the odds of a repeat visit to the low $30s (as an initial target) increase by the day.</p><p>Belcher (16-6, 7-4 UFC) is in his first match since having two surgeries on a detached retina he suffered while training last summer. He has won four of his past five matches and has back-to-back wins over Patrick Cote and Wilson Gouveia. The win over Cote won Belcher Submission of the Night, and the fight against Gouveia was Fight of the Night.</p><p>Spot gold prices lost $35 in overnight dealings after having shed more than $24 on Wednesday after the Fed announcement made it clear that Mr. Bernanke was not going to "go big." December gold fell more than $54 in electronic trading as the aforementioned beneficiary of the FOMC's new "twist" left traders ...twisting in agony about the near-term prospects of everything from gold, to silver, to copper, and to crude oil (now nearing $82).</p><img src='http://img2.lln.crunchyroll.com/i/spire4/03012008/3/4/b/9/34b94578a50cd0_full.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='belly-chains.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='Dystopia.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
