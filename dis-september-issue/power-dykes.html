Warning: Graphic content  Full Article </p><p>President Barack Obama's Oil Spill Commission came up with significantly different findings about the cause of the spill than the Coast Guard-Interior report that was finally released last week. The presidential commission, with no subpoena power, determined the root causes of the spill were systemic and industry-wide, something that some experts disagreed with. By contrast, the Coast Guard-Interior report, the official accident investigation based on months of sworn testimony and subpoenaed records, placed the blame for key causes of the explosion squarely at BP's feet.</p><p>Above all, Zhu coaxed and cajoled China's way into the World Trade Organization in 2002 through grueling negotiations.
