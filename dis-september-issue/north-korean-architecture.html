The answer: they wanted a healthy place to live.        </p><p>“I was amazed by what Pyongyang looked like,” McNamara says. “A fair amount of the buildings had a retro futuristic design to them. They reminded me of almost a Jetsons look. The ’50s and ’60s design elements meshed in a strangely wonderful fashion with the traditional Korean architecture.”</p><p>“I think somewhere between what we saw and her book lies the truth about North Korea, which I’m never going to have access to. But what we saw was real as well. There’s a lot of nuance to life there.”</p><p>"Even though we still have an unacceptable loss," due to the improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, "we're catching a lot of them," he said.</p><p>tagged with Asian studies, Government and Law, History, Study Abroad</p><p>
The rebirth of the South Bronx isn’t news. But Via Verde is. And it makes as good an argument as any new building in the city for the cultural and civic value of architecture. The profession, or in any case much talk about it, has been fixated for too long on brand-name luxury objects and buildings as sculptures instead of attending to the richer, broader, more urgent vein of public policy and community engagement, in which aesthetics play a part.        </p><p>It’s not the trip. You’re free to go wherever you please but it is the signing of a contract with the DPRK that restricts conversations with the press and other interested parties that is offensive. That agreement puts the college’s imprimatur on the propaganda efforts of a roque regime. If the contract didn’t exist I’d be all in favor. Which is the point of Mr. Goldwein’s letter, and his totally appropriate analogy with the Red Cross’ visit to Nazi concentration camps.  I doubt, if you were publically critical of the conditions of the impoverished populace or the 200,000 people imprisoned referred to by the Washington Post, that we would be invited back. Sadly, in some quarters, like in 1939, the point has been lost.</p><p>

    </p><p>You don’t understand, do you? We can talk about our experiences, the people with whom we spoke, and the places we went. There is very little that we can not speak about. You want hear stories about suffering and pain? That’s all on you. We told the media what they wanted to know. Whether they think we were being pressured to not talk is their own misconception.

That’s all on you. We told the media what they wanted to know. Whether they think we were being pressured to not talk is their own misconception. If you don’t believe me, then I’m sorry.</p><p>In regards to the contract we signed, never were we once told to specially not speak to the media. We are allowed to speak with whomever we want. We are only encouraged to watch what we say. What we do say, however, is what we know, what we saw, what we experienced. The reason we do not discuss the 200,000 imprisoned individuals is because that particular piece of knowledge is 1) so well known that none of us forget it when considering the DPRK, and 2) it had little to do with our trip. </p><p>"We were going to protect our people, the core people of our mission," Carlson said.</p><p>People from across the beach gathered to watch and applauded with enthusiasm for both teams.</p><p>“I was challenged to a swimming race by a North Korean police officer,” says Fahey, an international economics and commerce major and midfielder on Lafayette’s lacrosse team. “I thought it was only going to be a few feet, but it was halfway across the bay.”</p><p>The biggest tourist attraction in the country by far is the Kim Il Sung Tomb Palace.

And speaking of trips constructed to NOT show people the bad parts of a country, how many trips have you heard of for tourists to America to see the areas of poverty in Camden or Harlem? Sounds like a fun vacation to me…
You simply don’t want to believe that people can find a shred of happiness there. We are NOT North Korea apologists. We are NOT saying that everyone is happy. We are NOT saying that all we saw was happy-go-lucky times. And we are certainly NOT denying that people are dying there.
People like you need to stop trying to put words in our mouths…cheers.</p><p>The story of Kim Il Sung’s life and death was told in epic and somber fashion and the place was packed with tourists and citizens.</p><img src='http://put.edidomus.it/domus/binaries/imagedata/019_02_big.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='child-prostitute-costume.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='sarah-palin-look-alikes-.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
