as fact and combined with 'anonymous' sources," said the

Rubin [no relation], a former assistant secretary of state hired by Bloomberg News just 10 months ago to help lead its new opinion-writing section, has left his job after a rocky start . . .  Those who worked with him said that Mr. Rubin, who had no former journalistic experience, struggled to fit into a newsroom culture and at times clashed with his colleagues.” Alas, he learned everything he knows about journalism from his wife. </p><p>
True: “Amid the “will she or won’t she” speculation about former Alaska governor Sarah Palin’s 2012 presidential plans, one important thing seems to be getting lost: Palin is simply not a top-tier candidate.”</p><p>Sarah Palin made comments on Fox News Tuesday that suggest she might be leaning against a presidential run. At this late hour in the primary season, it might be a moot point, anyway. </p><p>

        </p><p>For serious candidates, the point of running for president is not to say what they want – it’s to get to sit in the chair in the Oval Office and run the executive branch. Mitt Romney probably daydreams about that on his campaign plane. (“President Romney, Vice President Perry has been waiting for an hour. Should I tell him lunch is off?”) His campaign message is a means to an end, not the other way round.</p><p> Among the more sensational allegations contained in the

have had as a 23-year-old sports reporter with a future
professional basketball player.</p><p>Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news, world news, business news, technology news, headline news, small business news, news alerts, personal finance, stock market, and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video, mobile, and interactive television platforms.
