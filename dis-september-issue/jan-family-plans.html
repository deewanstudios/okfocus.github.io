	Northern Oklahoma Resource Center of Enid officials are in the process of getting input from employees and family members of residents as part of a review process on the future of the facility.
	Meetings were held Sunday with family members of residents and Monday with employees. One family member said Tuesday morning he thinks the state is planning to close the facility because of a bill passed last legislative session that requires Department of Human Services to develop a plan to change or discontinue operations at state-operated NORCE and Southern Oklahoma Resource Center in Pauls Valley.
	Together, the two facilities care for about 250 severely disabled residents.
	Marcellius Bell, of Oklahoma City, whose brother resides at NORCE, said he told officials Sunday his brother receives good care and he is concerned about his alternatives if NORCE should close. His brother has been at NORCE since age 9 and now is in his 50s.
	“There has been some talk about putting them in the community, in a group home environment, but I haven’t looked into it,” he said.
	DHS has until Jan. 1 to submit to the Legislature a plan for the reorganization of NORCE and SORC. The bill also requires DHS officials to meet with families and employees before coming up with their plan. After the plan is submitted, the Legislature will have until March 12, 2012, to approve or reject the proposal, said State Senator Patrick Anderson, R-Enid.
	Most of the residents at NORCE would not be candidates for a group home setting because of the extent of their medical needs. The state is seeking a way to provide access more efficiently than maintaining two facilities in the state, Anderson said Tuesday.
	The effort is to provide residents with the best care possible, not an impractical push to remove some residents, he said.
	Anderson in May said both facilities have infrastructure problems, and it could cost up to $60 million to make all the repairs. Anderson said Tuesday officials may look at a new building for NORCE. The organization recently built new cottages and may build additional ones in the future.
	“One challenge at both campuses is the infrastructure is so old, it in many cases is less expensive to build new than renovate existing buildings,” Anderson said. “It’s certainly an effort to provide the residents with the best care possible. It’s not a push to move some residents into the community. They are not candidates for it.”
	DHS Commission Chairman Richard DeVaughn of Enid said his organization must interview the caretakers and facility staff, then present a proposal to the commission. He expects that report within 60 days and said the commission probably will vote on the recommendation by the December or January meeting.
	“We should have them by the end of October to mid-November, then they will be assimilated with the commission and presented to the legislature in January,” DeVaughn said.</p><img src='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qtdqS6PurOU/S3iSJaI75uI/AAAAAAAAAOg/OTUP3Gxo2M4/s320/jan-family-1.jpg' /><p>ENID —

McLoda, Robert Campana and Fred Alspach approved a resolution allowing park Director-Secretary Dan Martin to advertise for design-build services for the center.The board’s resolution did not include more details about the center, but Martin said he wants to bring a proposal back to the board in December to hire a designer-builder.The park district will publish a request for proposals in the next week or so, Martin said.“My guess is, with the economy, we’re going to see lots and lots of proposals,” he said. “We’re going to see, we think, very good square footage prices given the state of the economy right now.”There will be public meetings to learn what residents want in the new rec center, which will be located behind Premier Toyota, 47190 Cooper Foster Road.“We’re not going to move dirt till next spring anyway, so we’ve got time here,” Martin said. “The real decision’s in December when they have all the data,” he said, referring to the park commissioners.Wellness center plans include a gymnasium, indoor pool, a special needs play area and a bike trail through the 22 acres of donated land.Lorain County Metro Parks also will imitate or change some design features of the Splash Zone in Oberlin, but Martin said the new center will not be a carbon copy of the Splash Zone in a new location. Park staff have toured about 14 facilities in the last two months to research design features of fitness centers, he said.The construction process also will differ as the new center uses a design-build consultant. The Splash Zone had a general contractor with work subdivided into 13 areas, Martin said.
