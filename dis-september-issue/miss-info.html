Orson Charles had a pass bounce off his chest, and it was eventually caught by an Ole Miss defender for the interception. The Bulldog defense bailed out the offense - a theme this season - with another three-and-out.
</p><p>3. Whiskey Folk Ramblers – Friday @ 4:15 -- If you’re in the mood for gettin’ down on Friday, it’s a musical happy hour with Whiskey Folk Ramblers, the first set of the festival. Sure, you might have to leave work early (cough, cough), but it’s worth it. The Whiskey Folk Ramblers play music that may as well be the soundtrack of Fort Worth – folky, Americana tunes mixed with some killer guitar.</p><p>2. Oil Boom – Saturday @ 1:30 -- These boys can rock. Just off the release of their debut album in May, I’m totally ready for Oil Boom to rock my socks off on Saturday afternoon. If you don’t believe me, check the video below from their July performance at the Kessler. If you’re not chair dancing halfway through, you might be a zombie.</p><p>
- Damian Swann, who got hurt against Coastal Carolina, stayed home. That's a surprise, because Swann practiced during the week and there wasn't a hint that the freshman cornerback, who was credited with a start last week, would be out.
</p><p>
(Speaking of freshman receivers, Chris Conley has now played, so that redshirt is off as well.)
</p><p>
I would assume they're just giving LeMay some travel experience, and Parker Welch is still the third-string quarterback today.

Bigger step: Beating Mississippi State and Dan Mullen next Saturday.

Georgia is back in control, thanks to a Bacarri Rambo interception - off an absolute duck of a throw by Randall Mackey - and then Aron White. The Georgia tight end had his first touchdown catch of the year, for 35 yards, which followed a nice catch-and-cut for a first down play.

11:40 a.m.: Williams back at safety (apparently)

14:30 left in fourth quarter, Georgia still leads 24-13
</p><p>
I've questioned before whether Georgia makes enough use of its talented tight ends. Well in this first half White and fellow tight end Orson Charles have now combined for five catches and 80 yards and two touchdowns.
</p><p>
10:50 a.m.: Wooten and Brown out

Georgia is clearly the better team here, but it can't give the Rebels any opening. They're at home, and just as desperate for a win as the Bulldogs.

- Mike Gilliard leads the team with six tackles. Amarlo Herrera, making the start at inside linebacker, is second with four.

Kenarious Gates was also announced as the starting right guard, in place of Chris Burnette, who is on the dress list but is dealing with a knee injury.
</p><p>
I still don't think Ole Miss capable of turning this into a real problem. But Georgia should have put this away long ago.

Just when you thought Georgia would head into the locker room with a commanding lead, Ole Miss returns a punt 84 yards, off of a trick play reverse. (Freshman Nick Marshall, bless his heart, couldn't make the key tackle near midfield, and Nikolas Bassell was gone.)

Marlon Brown also missed the trip with his previously disclosed ankle injury. That's not a surprise.

Final: Georgia 27, Ole Miss 13
