Do you think we should give him another chance, then?"</p><p>She felt a little dizzy. With the heady violence over, she was coming down from her adrenaline rush. Without thinking she put her hand on the other woman's shoulder to steady herself, looking down and breathing deeply. Wow; really a fine tee shirt. A big Blake's 7 logo. Nice.</p><p>Ronnie stood there, her hand to her mouth. The day had taken an odd turn.</p><p>"That's the one."</p><p>Wow, she thought. Look at all the Doctors. She was glad to see the parade of Doctor Who enthusiasts weren't just doing characters from the new version of the show; there were Doctors from the 1970s and '60s. Tom Baker's version of the Doctor was always her favorite. She thought, Everything I love happened before I was born. Hey, it's K-9!</p><p>It was hard to get Shane to make eye contact, but there was nothing shy about his mouth. Ronnie was surprised Shane had even heard of Diana Rigg. Against her better judgement, she asked, "You like Mrs. Peel, do you?" Without hesitation he said, "I'd hit that like a historically accurate one-quarter scale steam locomotive on the Stapleford Miniature Railroad." It was amazing, sometimes, the assortment of facts that did and did not reside in Shane's head.</p><p>She felt bad about that, though she wasn't quite in control of herself at the time. There'd been a red haze, a roaring in her ears, and then her foot just lashed out and effortlessly struck home. As a momentary experience, it was actually better than some sex she'd had.</p><p>They got jambalaya and compared their Con schedules. Ronnie was hitting a lot of things listed under Science, Space, and Skepticism. Cherie's schedule included more headings like Tolkien, Dark Fantasy, and Paranormal Events. There wasn't much overlap.</p><p> People of the ba ling hou generation are said to be characterized by their love-hate feelings toward Japan, which partly stem from deep-rooted anti-Japan sentiment in China's nationalistic education system. They embody "tsundere," the cold and hostile attitude of a person toward another that gradually turns into affection.</p><p>She was having second thoughts about the small joke she'd planned. Her jokes always fell flat; besides, the girl had probably heard it ten times today. She went on from second to third thoughts, and took a couple of steps back. She'd lost momentum; too late. She put her hands in her pockets and imagined herself inside a glass tube, cut off from human contact. She felt as if she'd lost a friend, and felt ridiculous for feeling that way. She'd never had many female friends; maybe she'd just now missed out on making one. I'll always wonder.</p><p>Cherie said, "It's not a button, you know." She pointed to her neck. "Back there."</p><p>Hey, there went a whole group of Indiana Joneses. Male, female, fat, petite. The parade was definitely underway.</p><p>She wasn't often able to look another woman in the eyes on the same level. They were almond-shaped, dark brown eyes, almost bronze, as if they had flecks of metal in them. So much more interesting than the drab hazel eyes Ronnie was used to in the mirror.</p><p>"Thanks, Beamish."Â  Ronnie grinned; she felt her mouth stretching like it hadn't in a long time. Her cheeks would get sore if this kept up; she didn't care. She reflected that not having a man wasn't so bad. Having friends without the tension and distraction of sex was definitely easier. "Hey, maybe we'll run into Lamar this weekend. He's probably here, chatting up some other girl half a head taller than he is."</p><p>Usually when someone asked Ronnie about her religious beliefs (which seemed to happen a lot in Georgia), she gave a short, diplomatic speech she'd long ago memorized. But to Cherie, she just said, "Nope. Stone-cold atheist."</p><p>So she studied the head. It blocked her view like an occluding planet. Chick must be her own height, six feet. Thick black hair, kept up with a long lacquered pin. Probably a pain to get a brush through that stuff. The sunlight brought out glints of different shades. On either side of the head dangled earrings made of strings of little shells.</p><img src='http://static.becomegorgeous.com/img/articles/new_trend_anime_contact_lenses.jpg' /><p>So she studied the head. It blocked her view like an occluding planet. Chick must be her own height, six feet. Thick black hair, kept up with a long lacquered pin. Probably a pain to get a brush through that stuff. The sunlight brought out glints of different shades. On either side of the head dangled earrings made of strings of little shells.</p><p>Cherie's smile was huge. "You're the Ronnie that kicked Lamar in the family jewels!" She laughed. "I was hangin' around the wrong park completely, like a dork, while you were giving him the business!" She grabbed Ronnie and kissed her on the cheek. "Wicked!"</p><p>Cherie raised her black eyebrows. "What, Lamar Carmichael?"</p><p>So far, amongst parade participants and spectators, she'd seen costumed comic book heroes, comic book villains, endless variations on denizens from Star Wars, Doctor Who and a dozen anime series (played straight, played for laughs, or played for obscure in-jokes that she wasn't sure she got). Characters from moronic children's cartoons, unaccountably beloved by adults. Characters from endless time-sucking video games.</p><p>A rushing as of mighty waters filled Ronnie's ears; a red haze clouded her vision. Even as the black-haired girl was turning around, Ronnie found herself taking two long strides forward, putting her hand to the man's throat. She bent at the knee, pivoted, and put him over her leg and onto his back on the sidewalk, her knee holding him down, her hand still on top of his trachea.</p><p>They found space on one of the benches at Peachtree Centre. Ronnie said, "I'm so sorry for making a scene."</p><p>And she'd seen countless young people who somehow made her feel old at 25. She found herself missing college. Not that it was always happy; but at least, back then (two whole years) it felt like there was a reason for being where she was.</p><p>"Yeah; Cherie Beamish. Lovely to meet you."</p><p> Readers of Chugoku must be impressed by the fact that Yue is an ordinary woman from Shenyang, northeastern China. Given the state of recent Japan-China relations--which aren't exactly blossoming--the path to Jinsan and Yue's marriage mustn't have been an easy one--especially considering Jinsan is 14 years Yue's senior. </p><p>Somehow, she felt naked without a costume. Like a tourist. She'd decided against her black leather Emma Peel costume. She loved it, but it drew the wrong men, like flies to honey. Too hot, anyway, for Atlanta on Labor Day weekend. Shane had offered to sew her a new costume based on one of Peel's colored jumpsuits with strategic cutouts and zippers. He said he could use moisture-wicking synthetic fabric; he promised it would be "even better than being naked."</p><p>"Come down and see it, Babcock.Â  I could show you."</p><p>Write your message below.</p><p>The man said, "No I haven't!"</p><p>And she could see what Mr. Redshirt was talking about; the tee was a little snug, enough anyway to make it clear the girl didn't care for bras. Ronnie had never felt comfortable in public without one.</p><p>Aardvark, this is your fault, she thought. Not only had he taught her the move, but the weeks of handling stones and bricks with him had given her more upper-body strength than she'd ever had.</p><p>"That's right."</p><p>"Another chance to do what? Nah, not really. You can if you want to."</p><p>
