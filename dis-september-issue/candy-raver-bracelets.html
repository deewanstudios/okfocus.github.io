While Rotella pushed on, Richards worked as a techno A&R rep for Rick Rubin's American label. In 2007, he returned to promotion, differentiating his HARD events by banning glow sticks, plush toys, and candy. Next year Richards will host a three-night party on a cruise liner called Holy Ship! "I realized you gotta make it into a proper festival, not a rave. Your days are numbered if you're not legit."</p><p>Seems like more and more posts are just about "EDC" and the "raves" they throw.  How about the hundreds if not thousands of other events, parties, and other such similar productions that involve Electronic Dance Music that go off without a hitch? </p><p>In many ways, Vegas set a new standard.  Insomniac enforced an 18-and-over cap, hired ER doctors, increased security, set up free water stations, and added "Ground Control," a volunteer staff of young people who monitored their peers in exchange for free tickets. Insomniac had spent an estimated $20 million on getting the event right, according to company owner Pasquale Rotella, which included what Insomniac senior advisor Phil Blaine calls "a couple million" on DJs and nonmusic entertainment. No one died and reviews were positive -- good news for the estimated 500,000 people who  attend Insomniac's mega-raves annually.</p><p>To say "If there's a way to make these events safe, I'd be happy to talk about it..." is rather close minded.  They happen all the time.  They just don't make the news.</p><p>"If there's a way to make these events safe, I'd be happy to talk about it," says commission member, potential mayoral candidate, and billionaire mall tycoon Rick Caruso, 52. "I don't think there is. We've stopped them at the Coliseum for now -- I hope permanently. I was glad to see the promoter moved onto Vegas."</p><p>In 1994, a prohibitive British act passed, aimed at events that featured "the emission of a succession of repetitive beats." Toronto and Chicago both approved anti-rave laws in 2000. In 2002, then-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware  introduced the Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act (spelling out "RAVE," in case there was any question), which would've updated a 1970 law regarding crack houses  so that dance promoters could be punished for attendees' drug use. In 2005, the Czech Republic's peaceable CzechTek fest was shut down by 1,000 riot police armed with tear gas, water cannons, and a tank -- simply over a permit issue.</p><img src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Candy_To_Trade.jpg/220px-Candy_To_Trade.jpg' /><p>In 1994, a prohibitive British act passed, aimed at events that featured "the emission of a succession of repetitive beats."

There was a feeling that the thriving scene had peaked in 1993 with Rave America, which drew 40,000 to the Knott's Berry Farm theme park. In 2001, that event's organizer Gary Richards, a.k.a. Destructo, told spin that "back then, there were no parameters. Now everything's been done." Today he recognizes the value of acknowledging parameters.</p><p>"We kind of hold the torch for the whole dance community," says Rotella. "There's a lot of weight on our shoulders to have no problems -- even problems that are the norm. It's difficult; should we bubble-wrap every single person that comes to the show? But we're totally willing to deal with that, and we'll keep fighting to produce the best events we can."</p><p>"Compared to Raiders games or other concerts, they're a dream," says LAPD Commander Andrew Smith, 49, who oversaw the police presence at EDC 2010. "I've worked dozens of these events and I can't recall ever seeing a fistfight. These kids are really nice folks, and the music isn't stopping anytime soon. It's unfortunate that L.A. can't take advantage of that right now. Hopefully, that will turn around."</p><p>More information about formatting options</p><img src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Candy_To_Trade.jpg/220px-Candy_To_Trade.jpg' /><div id='oknav'><div class='okleft'><a href='xavier-cha-human-advertisement.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-left.png' /></a></div><div class='okright'><a href='bling-ring.html'><img src='assets/images/arrow-right.png' /></a></div></body></html>
