After buying the nightclub for 'several million dollars' in '81, Pierre Cardin set about making it an international 'brand,' and today there are numerous products bearing the Maxim's name. Cardin has opened 25 Maxims throughout the world as well as several smaller Minims. Its wine cellar in Paris is still rich with 130,000 bottles, all French, although I have suggested they carry such California vintages as Justin and Laetitia. How I would love to ramble about sipping in that cellar! The menu has changed a great deal under the tutelege of the 36-year-old current chef, Olivier Guyon, with a lighter businessman's lunch being served and more salads available for dinner. But it still features Quail Eggs with Iranian caviar, Langoustine with Eggplant Charlotte, Stuffed Saddle of Lamb (my favorite) and the magnificent Lobster Feuillete Maxim's.</p><p>

</p><p>A couple of miles away, another bus sat parked in a courtyard within Torres High School. Inside were Heat assistant coaches David Fizdale and Chad Kammerer, two NBA Asia employees, and Spoelstra's sister, Monica Spoelstra Metz. Outside the van were more than a thousand restless teenagers eager to see the NBA's only half-Filipino head coach. Actually, the students were excited to see pretty much anyone foreign. I made it three steps past the school's gates when a swarm of young girls and boys spotted me and started shrieking. A few kids screamed "Younghusband!" — a reference to Phil Younghusband, the Filipino-British star of the men's national soccer team who dates a famous actress and appears topless on canned-tuna billboards. No one actually believed I was Younghusband; they only meant that I looked foreign enough to be someone worth squealing over, that I must have come from somewhere far away from Tondo. And they were right — I had arrived earlier that morning on a Philippine Airlines flight from Los Angeles. I had dropped in on the middle of Spoelstra's weeklong trip to the country, and would be spending the next four days following him around to basketball clinics, mall appearances, and family gatherings. Unlike Spoelstra, I don't have any Philippine heritage, but the visit was homecoming for me, too. I spent three years in the Philippines, starting in 2005, to learn about the country's love for basketball, and the opportunity to watch Spoelstra interact with local fans and connect with his roots felt like a logical extension of that work.</p><p>

The plan to play in the Philippines fell through when he heard he might have to spend a season in the minor leagues while waiting to receive dual citizenship instead of going straight to the PBA. "It got delayed, and I never got an affirmative answer," Spoelstra said. "I couldn't just get drafted from the States. There was some kind of plan, but it sounded really shady, so I ended up playing for peanuts in front of 500 people in Germany. Looking back on it, it was a crazy decision."</p><p>Today's News</p><p>
			
			 Wednesday 28 September 2011</p><p>On one bus ride from his hotel to a Mall of Asia appearance, Spoelstra peppered me with questions. He seemed almost hungry to understand what it was like to live in Manila, to experience the city's chaotic side that his hosts wouldn't dare show him. How did you get around while you lived there?  Trains and jeepneys, mostly. How do you know where the jeepney stops, and how do you get off of it? It stops wherever you flag it down, and you get off by shouting "Para!" or plinking your finger on the roof. How did people respond to seeing a 6-3 white guy wandering around their neighborhood? Often by inviting me into a basketball game. What was it like to play street games? Free-flowing and fun, until one team reaches "warning," the point before game point; after that, the ratio of bruises to made baskets soars. What did you play for? Everything from five-peso coins to the right to have the losers crawl between my legs to plastic baggies filled with ice water. You drank unfiltered water? Yes, and never had any problems, although I did lose sleep over a couple of memorably murky glasses. So you didn't get sick? Well, I did have hookworm for about a month, but that doesn't come from drinking water. What was it like? Unless you're into scat, you don't wanna know.</p><p>Spoelstra's trip to Manila was part of the NBA FIT program, the league's initiative to promote healthy lifestyles, and his visit to Torres was cosponsored by the Philippine Department of Health. Until the coach arrived, however, the students would have to settle for his assistants. As it turned out, this was not a problem. When Fizdale and Kammerer stepped down from the bus, a crowd of schoolgirls in uniform orange blouses and ankle-length maroon skirts erupted in applause, cheers, and shrieks. For two bald, bench-bellied assistant coaches in their late 30s and early 40s, this was an unusual response. They walked to the basketball court, where about 50 students wearing gym pants and gray NBA Cares T-shirts waited under the shade of an aluminum roof. A cordon of teachers encircled the court and shooed away students who tried to rush in for autographs.</p><p>Coach

In the late '50s, I became the public relations/ production guy for a wide-screen film company called Cinerama. After originally making several amazing tri-screen documentaries (This Is Cinerama), in 1962 we co-produced with MGM a huge Western feature called How The West Was Won.  It was truly an all-star vehicle because we enlisted the powerful, feared Hearst Hollywood columnist, Louella Parsons, as our ally in lining up the many stars, promising to give a hefty percentage of the film's profits to the writer's favorite charity, St. John's Hospital. No star could withstand her entreaties, and they turned out to work for a minimal salary... dozens and dozens, with three top directors also involved. The film turned out splendidly, and I decided to hold the world premiere in Paris.  I would be bringing in 300 journalists from all over the world for the event, and that city was a central location no one could turn down. The film company's dynamic president, Nicolas Reisini, and board member (and my mentor) Maurice Dolfuss, had very good connections with the French government, and we got them to go all-out for the event. The Guarde Republique with their ornate helmets and red uniforms holding raised swords served as the honor guard lining the red carpet, and we even brought over a few dozen real Indians from the Sioux nation with war paint to attend. My main preoccupation was where to hold the after-screening party, and the selection was obvious. MAXIM'S was then (as now) the most famous nightclub in the world, and I had dined there several times as a guest of my board members. So we held the spectacular event at this spectacular venue (3, rue Royal, in the heart of Paris). Believe me, it was a great success, a once-in-a-lifetime party.</p><p>
“I get a b--------- all the time,” he complained. “I take sufficient weekends 
  and holidays a year for any British woman, but that doesn’t mean I get 
  thanked. I get asked to take more.”

			</p><p>That morning, I walked to Torres from an elevated train stop near Manila's Chinese cemetery. It was an uncharacteristically balmy stroll for August, which is the heart of the Philippine rainy season, and along the way I stayed cool by drinking Cobra, an electric-chartreuse energy drink. The neon beverage, which was poured into a plastic bag so the bottle could be returned to the brewery and refilled, contains roughly the same ingredients as Red Bull, but in such concentrated amounts that each sip from my straw seemed to add three to five beats per minute to my heart rate. A block from the school, a hearse drove by me, blasting what sounded like an '80s Peter Cetera ballad. The name JHEREMIAH was stenciled in the window in yellow bubble letters, and I wondered if Jheremiah was the name of the undertaker's son or the deceased. My guess: the former. This, among other things, is what I love about the Philippines. The country keeps you guessing, and I hoped that somehow, in the midst of a stage-managed NBA tour or Manila, I'd get a chance to see Spoelstra interact with this side of the country.</p><p>
Imagine life in Jamie Oliver’s house last Sunday: Jools, slim and looking 
  younger than her 37 years in fleecy pyjamas, rushes around feeding the four 
  kids; checking the elder two have school uniforms for Monday; mentally 
  devising the week’s activities for the youngest two and trying to have a 
  conversation with Jamie about his forthcoming travel plans while he checks 
  his BlackBerry. 
</p><p>The Spoelstra charm was on display throughout his week in Manila, and not just among his fellow basketball coaches. During one mall appearance, Spoelstra volunteered to hold a female fan's digital camera out so he could squish into a self-shot with her — his longer arms could give the photo a better angle. At his hotel's brunch buffet Spoelstra temporarily put off filling his plate with sushi to take pictures with a waiter, who passed the coach's plate to a busboy so it wouldn't mar the shot. Then the busboy wanted to get in the frame, so he passed the plate to a chef for another snapshot. Next, the chef passed the plate to a hostess so he, too, could get a photograph. Before long, Spoelstra was standing with about six hotel employees, his smiling face and plain, yellow polo shirt in the middle of a burst of purple and turquoise restaurant uniforms and chef's toques. Once everyone's photo request had been indulged, Spoelstra's plate made its way back to him.</p><p>See our paid archives for news older than a week.</p><p>
“She’s a wonderful person, kind and she’s very sweet and sensitive and caring. 
  But if I come home and give the 360 on everything I’m doing, then all I’ll 
  do is another eight-hour day. I’m not a worrier, but she worries about a lot 
  of what I do. I don’t need that, and she doesn’t need that.”

			No Slave To Fashion
		</p><p>After the group photo the students were given the green light to pursue any autograph or cell phone picture they desired, and in a matter of seconds bedlam ruled the courtyard. Spoelstra was hustled away to a classroom for a press conference, but Fizdale and Kammerer were left in the scrum. A horde of teenagers surrounded each coach and presented spiral notebooks, sweaty handkerchiefs, and assorted limbs for them to sign. When Kammerer tried to sign a notebook, another student placed his notebook above the other one, and when Kammerer tried to sign that notebook, another kid jammed his forearm between the page and Kammerer's pen. This went on for at least 20 minutes, until the coaches were summoned to the bus. It was noon already, and they had to get to another clinic. Away from the mob, Fizdale said: "I don't think I've ever felt swarmed like that. I think I signed some kids' heads."</p><p>Winkle, the NBA Asia official who has accompanied Spoelstra during each of his visits, said things were pretty low-key back in 2009. The coach could walk through a crowded mall and hardly be noticed by other shoppers. Times have changed. The day before I arrived in August, President Noynoy Aquino made time to host Spoelstra at the Malacañang Palace, where he briefed the coach on his plan to grow the Philippine economy. And later in the week, when Spoelstra had an appearance at the SM Mall of Asia, hundreds of fans lined up just to shake his hand and ask him to sign a T-shirt.</p><p>
			Most Commented
		</p><p>"I can do this all day!" boasted Spoelstra. His wave of black hair was starting to glisten with sweat and his shirt clung to a wet spot on his lower back. Luckily — for the students — the NBA had a schedule to keep. After a half hour of drills, Spoelstra and his assistants joined school administrators, a Manila city councilman, and higher-ups from the departments of health and education on a stage next to the court. The benefits of exercise, dedication, and public service were extolled; the Filipino speakers said "thank you" and the Americans said "maraming salamat"; and as many hundreds of students as could fit into a wide-angle camera shot were invited to pose with Spoelstra.</p><p>
The interviewer even gave him a chance to credit Jools, as his domestic 
  bedrock, with some of his success, but no.
