"Amid the tremendous surge of temperature-sensitive therapies coming to 
      market, it's critical to have the most reliable solutions in place to 
      help ensure the safe supply of healthcare products while also driving 
      cost and operational efficiencies for healthcare manufacturers," said 
      Mark Davis, product manager, UPS Healthcare Logistics. "The stakes are 
      high when there's a patient at the end of the supply chain, and UPS 
      strongly believes that the PharmaPort 360 will ensure better protection 
      of potentially life-saving therapies."

I skipped right to “16 Tons” because it’s one of my favorite tunes and I absolutely could see no way for a woman to convincingly sing that song. It’s always been the ultimate testosterone tune for me, right up there with “Big Bad John.” But you pulled it off. Tell me about choosing that, and how you approached singing a tune from the point of view of a miner.</p><p>

Only available through UPS, the PharmaPort(TM) 360 addresses a 
      key industry issue of safeguarding healthcare shipments in the supply 
      chain by enabling near real-time monitoring and maintaining product 
      temperatures in extreme outside conditions.

"Product losses from temperature excursions and mounting scrutiny from 
      regulatory authorities are pressuring healthcare companies to strengthen 
      supply chain compliance and gain more control through shipment data," 
      Davis added. "Having the information to prove that the integrity of a 
      vaccine or human tissue has been preserved in-transit, for example, is 
      almost as critical as the contents of the package."

Workshop - This is the place where guests turn into investigators and use real science to test myths. Is it true that an airplane won't be able to take off if it's on a conveyer belt running in the opposite direction?  Will you get less wet if you run rather than walk in the rain? Is a house made of brick less likely to fall victim to wind than one made of sticks? These are just a few of the questions guests will be challenged to answer.

Unlike other containers on the market, the PharmaPort 360 has built-in 
      sensors that not only monitor shipment condition and GPS location but 
      transmit this data to UPS's global control towers via GSM, a standard 
      global cellular network. Agents proactively monitor the container for 
      select "heartbeats" such as internal and external temperatures, near 
      real-time location and battery life. When alerts are triggered 
      indicating a potential risk, UPS agents can intervene with 
      pre-established contingency plans to rescue a shipment in distress and 
      prevent product loss.
